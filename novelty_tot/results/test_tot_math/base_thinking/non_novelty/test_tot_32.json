When $ n $ ends with $ k $ trailing 9s, adding 1 converts these $ k $ 9s to 0s and increments the next digit by 1. This reduces the digit sum by $ 9k $ and increases it by 1, resulting in a net change of $ -9k + 1 $. Thus, $ S(n+1) = 1274 - 9k + 1 = 1275 - 9k $. \n\nWe check which of the options can be written as $ 1275 - 9k $ for some integer $ k $.
