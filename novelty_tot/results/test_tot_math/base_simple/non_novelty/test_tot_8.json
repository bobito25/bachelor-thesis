Subtract this from the total area of the square to find the area of the region where $|x - y| \\leq 15$.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nYou must output exactly the next step in solving the problem when prompted. Output [FINISHED] when you are finished with solving the problem.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Allen and Bethany each arrive at a party at a random time between 1:00 and 2:00.  Each stays for 15 minutes, then leaves.  What is the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party?\nThis is the plan so far:\nModel the problem as a geometric probability question by considering the arrival times of Allen and Bethany on a coordinate plane, where the x-axis represents Allen's arrival time and the y-axis represents Bethany's arrival time, both measured in minutes after 1:00. The total possible arrival time range is from 0 to 60 minutes.\nThe next step is to define the condition for Allen and Bethany to see each other: their arrival times must be within 15 minutes of each other. This means the absolute difference between their arrival times must be less than or equal to 15 minutes, or $|x - y| \\leq 15$.\nThe next step is to graph the inequality $|x - y| \\leq 15$ on the coordinate plane within the square defined by $0 \\leq x \\leq 60$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 60$, and calculate the area of the region where this condition holds.\nThe next step is to calculate the area of the region where $|x - y| \\leq 15$ within the square, and then divide that area by the total area of the square (which is $60 \\times 60 = 3600$) to find the probability.\nThe next step is to calculate the area of the region where $|x - y| \\leq 15$ within the square. This region consists of the area between the lines $y = x + 15$ and $y = x - 15$. The area can be calculated by subtracting the areas of the two triangles outside this region from the total area of the square.\nNow you must find the next step.
