Let:\n- $a = 2^{x_1} \\cdot 5^{y_1}$\n- $b = 2^{x_2} \\cdot 5^{y_2}$\n- $c = 2^{x_3} \\cdot 5^{y_3}$\n\nThe least common multiple conditions become:\n- $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$, $\\max(y_1, y_2) = 3$\n- $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$, $\\max(y_2, y_3) = 3$\n- $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$, $\\max(y_3, y_1) = 3$\n\nNow analyze the constraints on the exponents of 2 and 5 separately. Start with the exponents of 2.\nAnalyze the constraints on the exponents of 2: $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$, $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$, $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$. Determine the possible values for $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$.\nThe constraints on the exponents of 2 are:\n- $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$\n- $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$\n- $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$\n\nFrom $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$, we know that at least one of $x_2$ or $x_3$ must be 4.\n\nFrom $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$, we know that at least one of $x_3$ or $x_1$ must be 4.\n\nFrom $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$, we know that both $x_1$ and $x_2$ must be less than or equal to 3.\n\nNow, since $x_1 \\leq 3$ and $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$, it follows that $x_3 = 4$.\n\nSimilarly, since $x_2 \\leq 3$ and $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$, it follows that $x_3 = 4$.\n\nThus, $x_3 = 4$. Now, we can determine the possible values for $x_1$ and $x_2$ given that $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$.\nThe possible values for $x_1$ and $x_2$ are such that $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$. This means that at least one of $x_1$ or $x_2$ must be 3, and both must be less than or equal to 3.\n\nNow, analyze the constraints on the exponents of 5: $\\max(y_1, y_2) = 3$, $\\max(y_2, y_3) = 3$, $\\max(y_3, y_1) = 3$. Determine the possible values for $y_1$, $y_2$, and $y_3$.\nThe constraints on the exponents of 5 are:\n- $\\max(y_1, y_2) = 3$\n- $\\max(y_2, y_3) = 3$\n- $\\max(y_3, y_1) = 3$\n\nThis means that all of $y_1$, $y_2$, and $y_3$ must be less than or equal to 3, and at least one of them must be equal to 3 in each pair.\n\nNow, count the number of ordered triples $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ that satisfy these constraints.\nNow you must find the next step.
