Start by identifying the first few nice numbers.\nCheck small natural numbers sequentially to determine if they are nice by calculating their proper divisors and verifying if the number equals the product of those divisors. Start with the number 2.\nCheck if 2 is a nice number by finding its proper divisors and calculating their product.\nCheck if 3 is a nice number by finding its proper divisors and calculating their product.\nCheck if 4 is a nice number by finding its proper divisors and calculating their product.\nNow you must find the next step.
