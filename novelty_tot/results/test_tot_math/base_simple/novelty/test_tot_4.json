Find the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers for which $[a,b] = 1000$, $[b,c] = 2000$, and $[c,a] = 2000$.\n\nThis is the plan so far:\nFactorize the given numbers into their prime factors:  \n$1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$  \n$2000 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3$  \n\nNow, consider the exponents of primes 2 and 5 in $a$, $b$, and $c$. Let:  \n$a = 2^{x_1} \\cdot 5^{y_1}$,  \n$b = 2^{x_2} \\cdot 5^{y_2}$,  \n$c = 2^{x_3} \\cdot 5^{y_3}$.  \n\nThe least common multiple conditions become:  \n- $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$, $\\max(y_1, y_2) = 3$  \n- $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$, $\\max(y_2, y_3) = 3$  \n- $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$, $\\max(y_3, y_1) = 3$  \n\nNow, find the number of ordered triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ satisfying the conditions for the exponent of 2. Then do the same for the exponent of 5. Multiply the two results to get the total number of ordered triples $(a, b, c)$.  \n\nNext step: Determine the number of ordered triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ such that $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$, $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$, and $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$.\nAnalyze the constraints for the exponents of 2:  \n- $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$ implies that both $x_1 \\leq 3$ and $x_2 \\leq 3$, and at least one of $x_1$ or $x_2$ is equal to 3.  \n- $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$ implies that $x_3 = 4$ or $x_2 = 4$, but since $x_2 \\leq 3$ from the previous condition, it must be that $x_3 = 4$.  \n- $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$ implies that $x_1 \\leq 4$ and $x_3 = 4$, which is already satisfied from the previous step.  \n\nNow, determine the number of ordered triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ with $x_3 = 4$, $x_1 \\leq 3$, $x_2 \\leq 3$, and $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$.\nThe number of ordered pairs $(x_1, x_2)$ such that $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$ and $x_1, x_2 \\leq 3$ is equal to the number of pairs where at least one of $x_1$ or $x_2$ is 3.
