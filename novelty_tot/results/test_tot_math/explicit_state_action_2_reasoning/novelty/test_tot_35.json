A \"nice\" number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that is equal to the product of its distinct proper divisors (excluding 1 and the number itself).

Not nice.\n- **3**: Proper divisors = none. Not nice.\n- **4**: Proper divisors = none (1 and 2 are excluded). Not nice.\n- **6**: Proper divisors = {2, 3}. Product = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6. **Nice**.\n- **8**: Proper divisors = {2, 4}. Product = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8. **Nice**.\n- **10**: Proper divisors = {2, 5}.

Product = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15. **Nice**.\n- **21**: Proper divisors = {3, 7}. Product = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21. **Nice**.\n- **22**: Proper divisors = {2, 11}. Product = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22. **Nice**.\n\nSo, the first ten nice numbers are: **6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 26, 27, 33**.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the sum\nNow, compute the sum of the first ten nice numbers:\n\n$$\n6 + 8 + 10 + 14 + 15 + 21 + 22 + 26 + 27 + 33 = 192\n$$\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n[OUTPUT] 192\n$$\nTo solve the problem, we need to identify the first ten \"nice\" numbers.
