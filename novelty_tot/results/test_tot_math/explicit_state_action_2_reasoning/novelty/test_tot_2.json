Since a cube has 8 vertices, and each face is part of 4 vertices, each face value will be included in the sum of 4 vertices.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the total sum of vertex values\nLet\u2019s denote the total sum of the vertex values as $ S $. Since each face value is used in the sum of 4 vertices, the total sum $ S $ is:\n$$\nS = 4(a + b + c + d + e + f)\n$$\n\n### Step 5: Determine the largest number that must divide $ S $\nSince $ S = 4(a + b + c + d + e + f) $, it is always divisible by 4, regardless of the values of $ a, b, c, d, e, f $.\n\nThus, the largest number that must divide the final sum for every possible numbering of the faces is **4**.\n\n[OUTPUT] The largest number that must divide the final sum for every possible numbering of the faces is 4.\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the cube structure\nA cube has:\n- **6 faces**\n- **8 vertices**\n- Each **vertex** is the meeting point of **3 faces**\n\n### Step 2: Assign values to faces\nEach face is assigned a **different integer**.

Since there are 8 vertices, we will compute the sum of the vertex values by summing all vertex values.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the sum of all vertex values\nEach face is part of **4 vertices** (since each face is adjacent to 4 vertices).
