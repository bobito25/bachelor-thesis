This involves analyzing the time intervals during which they are present at the party and finding the overlap between these intervals.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Define the time interval**: Both Allen and Bethany arrive at a random time between 1:00 and 2:00, which can be represented as a 60-minute interval. Let\u2019s use minutes past 1:00 as the unit of time, so the interval is from 0 to 60 minutes.\n\n2. **Define variables**: Let $ A $ be the time Allen arrives (in minutes after 1:00), and $ B $ be the time Bethany arrives. Both $ A $ and $ B $ are uniformly distributed between 0 and 60.\n\n3. **Determine when they see each other**: They will see each other if their time intervals at the party overlap. Since each stays for 15 minutes, Allen is at the party from $ A $ to $ A + 15 $, and Bethany is at the party from $ B $ to $ B + 15 $.\n\n4. **Condition for overlap**: They will see each other if:\n   $$\n   |A - B| < 15\n   $$\n   This ensures their time intervals overlap.\n\n5. **Visualize the problem**: This can be visualized on a coordinate plane where the x-axis represents Allen\u2019s arrival time $ A $, and the y-axis represents Bethany\u2019s arrival time $ B $. The total possible outcomes form a square with side length 60 (from 0 to 60 on both axes).\n\n6. **Find the area of overlap**: The condition $ |A - B| < 15 $ defines a band around the diagonal of the square. The area of this band represents the probability that they see each other.\n\n7. **Calculate the area**:\n   - The total area of the square is $ 60 \\times 60 = 3600 $.\n   - The area where $ |A - B| \\geq 15 $ consists of two right triangles, each with legs of length $ 60 - 15 = 45 $. The area of each triangle is $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 45 \\times 45 = 1012.5 $.\n   - Total area where they do **not** see each other: $ 2 \\times 1012.5 = 2025 $.\n   - Area where they **do** see each other: $ 3600 - 2025 = 1575 $.\n\n8. **Calculate the probability**:\n   $$\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Area where they see each other}}{\\text{Total area}} = \\frac{1575}{3600} = \\frac{7}{16}\n   $$\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party is $ \\frac{7}{16} $.\n\n[OUTPUT] The probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party is $ \\frac{7}{16} $.\nTo solve the problem, we model the situation using a coordinate plane where the x-axis represents the time Allen arrives and the y-axis represents the time Bethany arrives, both measured in minutes after 1:00 PM. Since both arrive randomly between 1:00 and 2:00, the total possible arrival time combinations lie in the square with vertices at (0, 0), (60, 0), (60, 60), and (0, 60).\n\nEach person stays for 15 minutes, so they will see each other if the difference between their arrival times is less than or equal to 15 minutes. This condition translates to:\n$$\n|x - y| \\leq 15\n$$\nWe are looking for the area of the region within the square that satisfies this inequality, divided by the total area of the square (which is $60 \\times 60 = 3600$).\n\nThe region where $|x - y| \\leq 15$ is the area between the lines $y = x + 15$ and $y = x - 15$ within the square. This forms a band across the square.\n\nThe area of the region where they do **not** see each other is the area of the two triangles outside the band. Each triangle has a base and height of $60 - 15 = 45$, so the area of one triangle is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 45 \\times 45 = 1012.5\n$$\nThe total area where they do not see each other is:\n$$\n2 \\times 1012.5 = 2025\n$$\nThus, the area where they **do** see each other is:\n$$\n3600 - 2025 = 1575\n$$\nThe probability is then:\n$$\n\\frac{1575}{3600} = \\frac{7}{16}\n$$\n\n[OUTPUT] The probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party is $ \\frac{7}{16} $.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Allen and Bethany each arrive at a party at a random time between 1:00 and 2:00.
