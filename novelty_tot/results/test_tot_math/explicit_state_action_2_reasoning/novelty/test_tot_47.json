We are given two sides: 6 cm and 8 cm. The third side can be either the hypotenuse or one of the legs, depending on whether the given sides are both legs or one leg and the hypotenuse.\n\nTo find the **shortest possible length** of the remaining side, we need to consider the two cases:\n\n### Case 1: The given sides are the legs (6 cm and 8 cm)\nIn this case, the hypotenuse (the longest side) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$\nc = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n$$\n$$\nc = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n$$\nSo, the hypotenuse is 10 cm.\n\n### Case 2: One of the given sides is the hypotenuse\nThis would mean the triangle has a hypotenuse of 8 cm and one leg of 6 cm. We can solve for the other leg:\n$$\na = \\sqrt{c^2 - b^2}\n$$\n$$\na = \\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 36} = \\sqrt{28} \\approx 5.29\n$$\n\nThe shortest possible length of the remaining side is **approximately 5.29 cm**.\n\n[OUTPUT] The shortest possible length of the remaining side is **5.29 cm**.\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the triangle with a right angle and two known side lengths: 6 cm and 8 cm. The goal is to find the **shortest possible length** of the remaining side.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. A triangle with a right angle is a **right-angled triangle**.\n2. In such a triangle, the **Pythagorean Theorem** applies:  \n   $$\n   a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n   $$\n   where $ c $ is the hypotenuse (longest side), and $ a $, $ b $ are the other two sides.\n\n3. We are given two sides: 6 cm and 8 cm. Depending on which side is the hypotenuse, the remaining side will be different:\n   - **Case 1**: If the hypotenuse is 8 cm, then the remaining side $ x $ is calculated as:  \n     $$\n     x^2 + 6^2 = 8^2 \\Rightarrow x^2 + 36 = 64 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 28 \\Rightarrow x = \\sqrt{28} \\approx 5.29\n     $$\n   - **Case 2**: If the hypotenuse is 6 cm, then the remaining side $ x $ is calculated as:  \n     $$\n     x^2 + 8^2 = 6^2 \\Rightarrow x^2 + 64 = 36 \\Rightarrow x^2 = -28\n     $$\n     This is **not possible** because a square of a real number cannot be negative.\n\n4. Therefore, the only valid configuration is when the hypotenuse is 8 cm, and the remaining side is approximately **5.29 cm**.\n\n### [OUTPUT]\nThe shortest possible length of the remaining side is **5.29 cm**.

Since the triangle has a right angle, it is a right triangle, and we can apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$$\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the two legs (sides forming the right angle),\n- $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).\n\nWe are given two sides, but we are not told which one is the hypotenuse.

We are to find the **shortest possible length** of the remaining side.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the triangle type\nSince the triangle has a right angle, it is a **right triangle**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the role of the given sides\nThere are two possibilities for the given sides:\n1. The two given sides (6 cm and 8 cm) are the **legs** of the triangle (the sides that form the right angle). In this case, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse:\n   $$\n   c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n   $$\n   So the hypotenuse is **10 cm**.\n\n2. One of the given sides is the **hypotenuse** (the side opposite the right angle), and the other is a **leg**. In this case, the hypotenuse is the **longest side**, so the hypotenuse must be 8 cm (since 8 > 6). The other leg can be found using:\n   $$\n   b = \\sqrt{c^2 - a^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 36} = \\sqrt{28} \\approx 5.29\n   $$\n\n### Step 3: Determine the shortest possible length\nBetween the two scenarios:\n- If the sides are legs, the remaining side is **10 cm**.\n- If one side is the hypotenuse, the remaining side is approximately **5.29 cm**.\n\nThus, the **shortest possible length** of the remaining side is **5.29 cm**.\n\n### [OUTPUT]\nThe shortest possible length of the remaining side of the triangle is **5.29 cm**.
