Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - Triangle $ \\triangle ABC $ is acute.\n   - Altitudes $ \\overline{AP} $ and $ \\overline{BQ} $ intersect at the orthocenter $ H $.\n   - We are given $ HP = 5 $ and $ HQ = 2 $.\n   - We are to find $ (BP)(PC) - (AQ)(QC) $.\n\n2. **Key Geometric Insight**:\n   - In triangle geometry, when altitudes intersect at the orthocenter $ H $, we can use properties of similar triangles and ratios involving segments created by the orthocenter.\n\n3. **Useful Theorem**:\n   - A known result in triangle geometry is that in an acute triangle, the product of the segments of the altitudes (from the orthocenter to the base and from the orthocenter to the vertex) are related to the sides of the triangle.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - We will use the fact that in triangle geometry, $ (BP)(PC) = (HP)(HA) $ and $ (AQ)(QC) = (HQ)(HB) $, based on properties of orthocenters and similar triangles.\n   - Therefore, we need to compute $ (HP)(HA) - (HQ)(HB) $.\n\n5. **Next Action**:\n   - We need to find the lengths of $ HA $ and $ HB $ to compute the required expression.\n\n[OUTPUT] Compute the lengths of $ HA $ and $ HB $ using the given values of $ HP = 5 $ and $ HQ = 2 $.\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\nWe are given that in triangle $ \\triangle ABC $, altitudes $ \\overline{AP} $ and $ \\overline{BQ} $ intersect at point $ H $, the orthocenter of the triangle. We are told:\n- $ HP = 5 $\n- $ HQ = 2 $\n\nWe are asked to compute the value of:\n$$\n(BP)(PC) - (AQ)(QC)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry\n\n- $ AP $ is the altitude from $ A $ to $ BC $, so $ P $ lies on $ BC $.\n- $ BQ $ is the altitude from $ B $ to $ AC $, so $ Q $ lies on $ AC $.\n- $ H $ is the orthocenter, the intersection of altitudes.\n- Since $ H $ lies on $ AP $, and $ HP = 5 $, then $ HA = AP - HP $.\n- Similarly, since $ H $ lies on $ BQ $, and $ HQ = 2 $, then $ HB = BQ - HQ $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use Known Properties of the Orthocenter\n\nThere is a known identity involving the segments of the altitudes and the triangle's sides. For triangle $ ABC $, if $ H $ is the orthocenter:\n$$\n(HA)(HP) = (HB)(HQ)\n$$\n\nThis identity is derived from the fact that the orthocenter divides the altitudes in a harmonic ratio with respect to the triangle's vertices and the foot of the altitudes.\n\nWe can now use this identity:\n$$\n(HA)(HP) = (HB)(HQ)\n$$\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n$$\n(HA)(5) = (HB)(2)\n$$\n\nSolve for $ HA $ in terms of $ HB $:\n$$\nHA = \\frac{2}{5}HB\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use Coordinate Geometry (Optional, for Further Insight)\n\nLet\u2019s consider coordinates to find expressions for $ BP \\cdot PC $ and $ AQ \\cdot QC $.\n\n- Place $ B = (0, 0) $, $ C = (3, 0) $, $ A = (2, 2) $ (from the Asymptote code).\n- Then, $ P = \\text{foot of } A \\text{ on } BC $, which lies on the x-axis.\n- Since $ A = (2, 2) $, the foot of the perpendicular from $ A $ to $ BC $ lies directly below $ A $ on the x-axis, so $ P = (2, 0) $.\n- Similarly, $ Q = \\text{foot of } B \\text{ on } AC $, which lies on $ AC $.\n\nWe can compute the coordinates of $ Q $, and then use them to find the distances $ AQ $, $ QC $, $ BP $, and $ PC $.\n\nBut we already have a more direct identity:\n$$\n(BP)(PC) - (AQ)(QC)\n$$\n\nThis expression is known to be equal to:\n$$\n(BP)(PC) - (AQ)(QC) = (HA)(HP) - (HB)(HQ)\n$$\n\nFrom earlier, we found:\n$$\n(HA)(HP) = (HB)(HQ)\n$$\n\nSo:\n$$\n(BP)(PC) - (AQ)(QC) = (HA)(HP) - (HB)(HQ) = 0\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$\n\n[OUTPUT] The value of $ (BP)(PC) - (AQ)(QC) $ is $ 0 $.
