Once we know $ x $, we can determine how fast Laura ran.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Convert the total workout time to hours:**  \n   The total workout lasts 110 minutes. Since speed is in miles per hour, we need to convert 110 minutes to hours:  \n   $$\n   \\frac{110}{60} = \\frac{11}{6} \\text{ hours}\n   $$\n\n2. **Time spent biking:**  \n   Laura bikes 20 miles at a speed of $ 2x + 1 $ miles per hour. The time spent biking is:  \n   $$\n   \\frac{20}{2x + 1} \\text{ hours}\n   $$\n\n3. **Time spent running:**  \n   Laura runs 5 miles at a speed of $ x $ miles per hour. The time spent running is:  \n   $$\n   \\frac{5}{x} \\text{ hours}\n   $$\n\n4. **Time spent on transition (parking, changing, etc.):**  \n   This is given as 5 minutes, which is:  \n   $$\n   \\frac{5}{60} = \\frac{1}{12} \\text{ hours}\n   $$\n\n5. **Set up the equation for total time:**  \n   The total time is the sum of the time biking, running, and transitioning:  \n   $$\n   \\frac{20}{2x + 1} + \\frac{5}{x} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{11}{6}\n   $$\n\n6. **Solve the equation for $ x $:**  \n   This is the next action.

Multiply both sides by this LCD to eliminate denominators:\n\n$$\n4x(2x + 1) \\left( \\frac{20}{2x + 1} + \\frac{5}{x} \\right) = 4x(2x + 1) \\cdot \\frac{7}{4}\n$$\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft-hand side:\n$$\n4x(2x + 1) \\cdot \\frac{20}{2x + 1} = 4x \\cdot 20 = 80x\n$$\n$$\n4x(2x + 1) \\cdot \\frac{5}{x} = 4(2x + 1) \\cdot 5 = 20(2x + 1) = 40x + 20\n$$\n\nSo the left-hand side becomes:\n$$\n80x + 40x + 20 = 120x + 20\n$$\n\nRight-hand side:\n$$\n4x(2x + 1) \\cdot \\frac{7}{4} = x(2x + 1) \\cdot 7 = 7x(2x + 1) = 14x^2 + 7x\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Set the equation\n\n$$\n120x + 20 = 14x^2 + 7x\n$$\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n$$\n14x^2 + 7x - 120x - 20 = 0\n$$\n$$\n14x^2 - 113x - 20 = 0\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation\n\nUse the quadratic formula:\n$$\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\nwhere $a = 14$, $b = -113$, $c = -20$.\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{113 \\pm \\sqrt{(-113)^2 - 4(14)(-20)}}{2(14)}\n$$\n$$\nx = \\frac{113 \\pm \\sqrt{12769 + 1120}}{28}\n$$\n$$\nx = \\frac{113 \\pm \\sqrt{13889}}{28}\n$$\n\nNow calculate $\\sqrt{13889} \\approx 117.85$\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{113 \\pm 117.85}{28}\n$$\n\nTwo possible solutions:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{113 + 117.85}{28} = \\frac{230.85}{28} \\approx 8.24\n$$\n$$\nx = \\frac{113 - 117.85}{28} = \\frac{-4.85}{28} \\approx -0.17\n$$\n\nSince speed cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\nx \\approx 8.24\n$$\n\n---\n\n[OUTPUT] Laura ran at approximately **8.24 miles per hour**, to the nearest hundredth.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Laura is training for a triathlon, but she doesn't feel like swimming.
