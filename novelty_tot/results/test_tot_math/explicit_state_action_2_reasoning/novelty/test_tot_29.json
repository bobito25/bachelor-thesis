Let's analyze the correct approach:\n\nTo count the number of rectangles in a $4 \\times 4$ grid of dots (which forms a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares), we need to count the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines and two vertical lines from the grid.\n\n- There are 5 horizontal lines (including the top and bottom boundaries) and 5 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries).\n- The number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines is $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$.\n- The number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines is also $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$.\n- Each pair of horizontal and vertical lines defines a unique rectangle.\n\nThus, the total number of rectangles is:\n\n$$\n\\binom{5}{2} \\times \\binom{5}{2} = 10 \\times 10 = 100\n$$\n\nThis matches the current state of the world, but it is **incorrect** for a $4 \\times 4$ grid of **dots** (not squares). The correct grid size for counting rectangles is based on the number of lines, not the number of dots.\n\nFor a $4 \\times 4$ **dot** grid, the correct number of horizontal and vertical lines is **5**, as the dots form a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\n[FINISHED]", "used_action_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.How many different rectangles with sides parallel to the grid can be formed by connecting four of the dots in a $4\\times 4$ square array of dots, as in the figure below?\n[asy]size(2cm,2cm); for (int i=0; i<4; ++i) { for (int j=0; j<4; ++j) { filldraw(Circle((i, j), .05), black, black); } } [/asy] (Two rectangles are different if they do not share all four vertices.)\nThis is the plan so far:\nCompute $\\binom{4}{2}$.\nThe total number of rectangles that can be formed is 100.\nCompute $\\binom{5}{2} \\times \\binom{5}{2}$.\nAfter applying the plan, this is the current state of the world:\nThe total number of rectangles that can be formed is 100.\nWhat is the next action to take based on the current state of the world to reach the goal?
