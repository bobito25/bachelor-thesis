The key idea is to consider how the sum of digits changes when we increment a number by 1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the behavior of $ S(n) $ when $ n $ is incremented\n\nWhen we go from $ n $ to $ n+1 $, the sum of the digits $ S(n+1) $ can change in two main ways:\n\n1. **No trailing 9s**: If the last digit of $ n $ is not 9, then incrementing $ n $ simply increases the last digit by 1. The sum of the digits increases by 1. For example:\n   $$\n   S(123) = 6, \\quad S(124) = 7\n   $$\n\n2. **Trailing 9s**: If the last digit or a sequence of digits is 9, incrementing $ n $ will cause those 9s to roll over to 0, and the digit before the trailing 9s will be increased by 1. This decreases the digit sum by $ 9 \\times k $, where $ k $ is the number of trailing 9s, and then increases it by 1 (from the carry).

We are to find a possible value of $ S(n+1) $.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the possible changes:\n\n- If $ n $ ends in a digit that is not 9, then $ S(n+1) = S(n) + 1 = 1275 $\n- If $ n $ ends in one 9, then $ S(n+1) = S(n) - 9 + 1 = 1274 - 8 = 1266 $\n- If $ n $ ends in two 9s, then $ S(n+1) = 1274 - 18 + 1 = 1257 $\n- If $ n $ ends in three 9s, then $ S(n+1) = 1274 - 27 + 1 = 1248 $\n- If $ n $ ends in four 9s, then $ S(n+1) = 1274 - 36 + 1 = 1239 $\n\nWe see that **1239** is a valid value of $ S(n+1) $, and it is one of the answer choices.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[OUTPUT] The value of $ S(n+1) $ could be $\\boxed{1239}$.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Let $S(n)$ equal the sum of the digits of positive integer $n$.
