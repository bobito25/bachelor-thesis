For example, the number 1230 is balanced because $1 + 2 = 3 + 0 = 3$.\n\n### Step 2: Iterate through all 4-digit integers\nWe need to consider all integers from 1000 to 9999, which are all the 4-digit numbers.\n\n### Step 3: Check the balanced condition for each number\nFor each number, we:\n1. Split it into its four digits: $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4$.\n2. Compute the sum of the first two digits: $d_1 + d_2$.\n3. Compute the sum of the last two digits: $d_3 + d_4$.\n4. If the two sums are equal, the number is balanced.\n\n### Step 4: Count the total number of balanced integers\nWe count all such numbers that satisfy the above condition.\n\n### Step 5: Efficiently compute the result\nRather than iterating through all 9000 numbers manually, we can compute it using a more efficient method:\n- The sum of two digits can range from 0 to 18.\n- For each possible sum $s$ from 0 to 18, we count how many ways we can get that sum from two digits (from 0 to 9 for the rightmost digits, and 1 to 9 for the first digit since the number is 4-digit).\n- Then we square the count of ways to get that sum (since both left and right pairs must match the same sum).\n- Finally, sum over all $s$.\n\nThis yields:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total balanced numbers} = \\sum_{s=0}^{18} (\\text{ways to get sum } s \\text{ with two digits})^2\n$$\n\nWe can calculate the number of ways to get each sum from two digits:\n- For example, sum = 0: only (0,0) \u2192 1 way.\n- Sum = 1: (0,1), (1,0) \u2192 2 ways.\n- ...\n- Sum = 9: (0,9), (1,8), ..., (9,0) \u2192 10 ways.\n- Sum = 10: (1,9), (2,8), ..., (9,1) \u2192 9 ways.\n- ...\n- Sum = 18: (9,9) \u2192 1 way.\n\nNow we square each count and sum them:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total} = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \\cdots + 10^2 + 9^2 + \\cdots + 1^2\n$$\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n$$\n2 \\times (1^2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 9^2) + 10^2\n$$\n\n$$\n= 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 19}{6}\\right) + 100\n$$\n\n$$\n= 2 \\times 285 + 100 = 570 + 100 = 670\n$$\n\n### Final Answer:\n[OUTPUT] There are **670 balanced integers** between 1000 and 9999.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.An integer between $1000$ and $9999$, inclusive, is called balanced if the sum of its two leftmost digits equals the sum of its two rightmost digits.
