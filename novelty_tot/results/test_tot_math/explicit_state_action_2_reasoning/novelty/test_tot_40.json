The ratio of the side lengths of the smaller tetrahedron to the larger one is $ \\frac{1}{3} $, since the centroids divide the medians in a $ 1:2 $ ratio.\n5.

The center of each face is the centroid of that triangle. The line from a vertex of the tetrahedron to the centroid of the opposite face is called a **median**, and these medians intersect at the **centroid** of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe four face centroids form the vertices of a smaller, similar tetrahedron inside the original one.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use Similarity to Determine the Ratio of Volumes\n\nSince the smaller tetrahedron is similar to the original one, the ratio of their volumes is the cube of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- $ s $: side length of the original tetrahedron.\n- $ s' $: side length of the smaller tetrahedron formed by the face centroids.\n\nWe need to find the ratio $ \\frac{s'}{s} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Ratio of Side Lengths\n\nThe centroid of a triangle divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio (2/3 from the vertex, 1/3 from the base). The face centroids are located at the center of each triangular face, and the smaller tetrahedron formed by these points is **similar** to the original one, but **scaled down**.\n\nIt can be shown (via vector geometry or coordinate geometry) that the smaller tetrahedron formed by the centroids is scaled down by a factor of $ \\frac{1}{3} $ from the original tetrahedron.\n\nThus:\n$$\n\\frac{s'}{s} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Volume Ratio\n\nThe volume of a tetrahedron is proportional to the cube of its side length. So the volume ratio is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\n$$\n\nSo the ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to the larger one is $ \\frac{1}{27} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nWe are given that the ratio is $ \\frac{m}{n} $, where $ m $ and $ n $ are relatively prime positive integers. Here, $ m = 1 $, $ n = 27 $, and:\n$$\nm + n = 1 + 27 = \\boxed{28}\n$$\n\n---\n\n[OUTPUT] The smaller tetrahedron formed by the face centroids of a regular tetrahedron has a volume that is $ \\frac{1}{27} $ of the original tetrahedron's volume.
