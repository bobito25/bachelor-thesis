In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, and each diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles. Given the side length and one diagonal, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the other diagonal.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Let the length of the shorter diagonal be $ d_1 = 48 $ units.\n2. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, so each half of the shorter diagonal is $ \\frac{d_1}{2} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24 $ units.\n3. Let the length of the longer diagonal be $ d_2 $, so each half of the longer diagonal is $ \\frac{d_2}{2} $.\n4. Since the diagonals intersect at right angles, the side of the rhombus (51 units) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 24 and $ \\frac{d_2}{2} $.\n5. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   $$\n   24^2 + \\left( \\frac{d_2}{2} \\right)^2 = 51^2\n   $$\n6.
