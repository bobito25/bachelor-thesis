This implies that $a$ and $b$ must have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n\nSince $2000^2 = 2^8 \\cdot 5^6$, it is even, so all its divisors are even. Therefore, all factor pairs $(a, b)$ will consist of even integers, and their sum and difference will also be even.\n\nThus, all 63 factor pairs yield valid integer solutions for $(x, y)$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of lattice points\nEach factor pair $(a, b)$ gives a unique solution $(x, y)$, and since the equation is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, we must also consider the negative factor pairs (e.g., $(-a, -b)$, etc.).\n\nThere are 63 positive factor pairs, and similarly 63 negative factor pairs, giving a total of $63 + 63 = 126$.\n\nBut wait\u2014this counts each solution twice (once for $(x, y)$ and once for $(-x, -y)$) unless $x = 0$ or $y = 0$, which is not the case here (since $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$, neither $x$ nor $y$ can be 0). So we need to avoid double-counting.\n\nActually, the factor pairs $(a, b)$ and $(-a, -b)$ yield the same solution $(x, y)$, but we have already considered all factor pairs, and we can treat each pair as unique.\n\nSo, the total number of lattice points is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Number of factor pairs} = 63 \\times 2 = 126\n$$\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThere are **126** lattice points on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$.\n\n[OUTPUT] The number of lattice points on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$ is **126**.\nTo find the number of lattice points on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$, we begin by factoring the left-hand side using the difference of squares:\n\n$$\nx^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) = 2000^2\n$$\n\nWe are looking for integer solutions $(x, y)$, which means $(x - y)$ and $(x + y)$ must be integer divisors of $2000^2$, and their product must equal $2000^2$. Let:\n\n$$\nx - y = a \\\\\nx + y = b\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nab = 2000^2\n$$\n\nAlso, from the equations above, we can solve for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{a + b}{2}, \\quad y = \\frac{b - a}{2}\n$$\n\nFor $x$ and $y$ to be integers, both $a + b$ and $b - a$ must be even. This means $a$ and $b$ must have the same parity (both even or both odd). Since $2000^2$ is even, both $a$ and $b$ must be even (as the product of two odd numbers is odd, and the product of an odd and an even number is even).\n\nWe now find the number of factor pairs $(a, b)$ of $2000^2$ such that $a \\leq b$ and $a$ and $b$ are both even.
