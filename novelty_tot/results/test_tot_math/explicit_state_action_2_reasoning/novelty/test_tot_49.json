Here's how we can approach it:\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Understanding the setup**: We have 54 cards in total, and the two jokers are indistinguishable (i.e., we don't care which joker is which). The deck is shuffled randomly, so all arrangements are equally likely.\n\n2. **Key observation**: The number of cards strictly between the two jokers is determined by the positions of the two jokers in the shuffled deck.\n\n3. **Define positions**: Let\u2019s denote the positions of the two jokers as $ X $ and $ Y $, where $ X < Y $ without loss of generality (since the jokers are indistinguishable). The number of cards strictly between them is $ Y - X - 1 $.\n\n4. **Expected value of $ Y - X - 1 $**: We want to compute $ \\mathbb{E}[Y - X - 1] $, which is equivalent to $ \\mathbb{E}[Y - X] - 1 $. So we need to compute $ \\mathbb{E}[Y - X] $.\n\n5. **Distribution of positions**: Since the deck is shuffled randomly, the positions of the two jokers are uniformly random among all possible pairs of positions $ (X, Y) $, with $ 1 \\leq X < Y \\leq 54 $.\n\n6. **Expected value of $ Y - X $**: We can compute this as follows:\n   - There are $ \\binom{54}{2} $ possible pairs of positions for the two jokers.\n   - For each possible pair $ (X, Y) $, the distance $ Y - X $ can range from 1 to 53.\n   - The expected value of $ Y - X $ is known to be $ \\frac{53}{3} $ (a standard result for uniform random positions in a line).\n\n7. **Final computation**:\n   $$\n   \\mathbb{E}[Y - X - 1] = \\mathbb{E}[Y - X] - 1 = \\frac{53}{3} - 1 = \\frac{50}{3}\n   $$\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers is $ \\frac{50}{3} $, or approximately $ 16.67 $.\n\n[OUTPUT] The expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers is $ \\frac{50}{3} $.\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers in a shuffled deck of 54 cards (52 regular cards + 2 jokers). Here's the reasoning in small steps:\n\n1. **Total number of cards**: 54.\n2. **Two jokers are indistinguishable in position** (we only care about their relative positions).\n3. **We consider all possible positions of the two jokers in the deck**. There are $ \\binom{54}{2} $ ways to choose two positions for the jokers.\n4. **Let the positions of the two jokers be $ i $ and $ j $, where $ i < j $**. The number of cards strictly between them is $ j - i - 1 $.\n5. **We compute the expected value** of $ j - i - 1 $ over all such pairs $ (i, j) $ with $ i < j $.\n6. **Expected value of $ j - i $** over all such pairs is known to be $ \\frac{53}{3} $ (a standard result in uniform random sampling).\n7. **Thus, the expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers is $ \\frac{53}{3} - 1 = \\frac{50}{3} $**.\n\n[OUTPUT] The expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers in a shuffled deck of 54 cards is $ \\frac{50}{3} $.
