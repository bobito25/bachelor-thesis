Since $ P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) $, the roots of $ P(x) $ are $ x = 1, 2, 3 $.\n\nSo, for $ x = 1, 2, 3 $, we have $ P(x) = 0 $, which implies:\n\n$$\nP(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x) = 0\n$$\n\nSo, $ P(Q(x)) = 0 $ when $ x = 1, 2, 3 $, which implies that:\n\n$$\nQ(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}\n$$\n\nThat is, the values $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $ must be in the set $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $\nWe are looking for the number of quadratic polynomials $ Q(x) $ such that $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\nThis is a standard interpolation problem. For each of $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $, we can assign any of the 3 values $ 1, 2, 3 $. Thus, the total number of such functions (not necessarily polynomials) is:\n\n$$\n3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\n$$\n\nHowever, not all of these functions will be quadratic polynomials. A quadratic polynomial is uniquely determined by its values at 3 distinct points. So, if we fix $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $, there exists a unique quadratic polynomial that satisfies these conditions.\n\nThus, each of these 27 assignments corresponds to a unique quadratic polynomial $ Q(x) $.\n\n### Final Step: Conclusion\nThere are **27** such polynomials $ Q(x) $.\n\n[OUTPUT] The number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $ is 27.\nTo solve the problem, we are given a polynomial $ P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) $ and asked to find how many polynomials $ Q(x) $ exist such that there is a polynomial $ R(x) $ of degree 3 satisfying:\n\n$$\nP(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the equation\n\nWe are told:\n$$\nP(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x)\n$$\n\nSince $ P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) $, we can write:\n$$\nP(Q(x)) = (Q(x) - 1)(Q(x) - 2)(Q(x) - 3)\n$$\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$\n(Q(x) - 1)(Q(x) - 2)(Q(x) - 3) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) \\cdot R(x)\n$$\n\nThis tells us that $ (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) $ divides $ (Q(x) - 1)(Q(x) - 2)(Q(x) - 3) $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the divisibility condition\n\nWe want $ (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) $ to divide $ (Q(x) - 1)(Q(x) - 2)(Q(x) - 3) $. This implies that the roots of $ P(x) $, which are $ x = 1, 2, 3 $, must also be roots of $ (Q(x) - 1)(Q(x) - 2)(Q(x) - 3) $.\n\nThat is:\n- $ Q(1) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $\n- $ Q(2) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $\n- $ Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $\n\nEach of the values $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $ has 3 possible choices (1, 2, or 3), and the choices are independent.\n\nSo, the total number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $ is:\n$$\n3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n[OUTPUT] The number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $ is **27**.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Let $P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$.
