Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. A standard deck has 26 black cards (spades and clubs) and 26 red cards (hearts and diamonds).\n2. The cards are dealt in a circle, so there are 52 adjacent pairs (each card has one neighbor to the left and one to the right, forming a loop).\n3. We define an indicator random variable $ X_i $ for each of the 52 pairs of adjacent cards, where $ X_i = 1 $ if both cards in the pair are black, and $ X_i = 0 $ otherwise.\n4. The total number of adjacent black pairs is $ X = \\sum_{i=1}^{52} X_i $.\n5. The expected value $ E[X] $ is $ \\sum_{i=1}^{52} E[X_i] $, because expectation is linear.\n6. For each pair, the probability that both cards are black is:\n   $$\n   P(\\text{both black}) = \\frac{26}{52} \\cdot \\frac{25}{51} = \\frac{25}{102}\n   $$\n   This is because the first card has a $ \\frac{26}{52} = \\frac{1}{2} $ chance of being black, and the second card has a $ \\frac{25}{51} $ chance of being black given the first card was black.\n7. Thus, $ E[X_i] = \\frac{25}{102} $ for each $ i $.\n8. Since there are 52 such pairs, the expected number of adjacent black pairs is:\n   $$\n   E[X] = 52 \\cdot \\frac{25}{102} = \\frac{1300}{102} = \\frac{650}{51}\n   $$\n\n[OUTPUT] The expected number of pairs of adjacent cards which are both black is $ \\frac{650}{51} $.\nTo solve the problem, we will break it down into small steps:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Setup**\nWe are given a **standard 52-card deck**, which contains:\n- **26 red cards** (hearts and diamonds)\n- **26 black cards** (spades and clubs)\n\nThese cards are **dealt in a circle**, meaning that the first card is adjacent to the last card as well.\n\nWe are asked to find the **expected number of adjacent pairs** where **both cards are black**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Count the Number of Adjacent Pairs**\nIn a circle of 52 cards, each card has **2 neighbors**, and each pair of adjacent cards is counted **once**.

The cards are dealt in a **circle**, forming 52 adjacent pairs (since the first card is adjacent to the last card in a circular arrangement).\n\nWe are to find the **expected number of adjacent card pairs that are both black**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use linearity of expectation\nLet\u2019s define an indicator random variable $ X_i $ for each of the 52 adjacent pairs in the circle. We define:\n$$\nX_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if both cards in the } i\\text{-th pair are black} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nLet $ X = \\sum_{i=1}^{52} X_i $ be the total number of adjacent black-black pairs.\n\nBy **linearity of expectation**, we have:\n$$\nE[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{52} E[X_i]\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute $ E[X_i] $\nEach pair of adjacent cards is equally likely to be any combination of black and red cards. The probability that both cards in a pair are black is:\n$$\nP(\\text{both black}) = \\frac{\\binom{26}{2}}{\\binom{52}{2}} = \\frac{26 \\cdot 25}{52 \\cdot 51} = \\frac{650}{2652} = \\frac{650}{51 \\cdot 52}\n$$\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s not the right approach.

After choosing the first card to be black (probability $ \\frac{1}{2} $), there are 25 black cards left out of 51 remaining cards.\n\nSo:\n$$\nP(\\text{both black}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{25}{51} = \\frac{25}{102}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Multiply by the number of pairs\nThere are 52 adjacent pairs in the circle, so:\n$$\nE[X] = 52 \\cdot \\frac{25}{102} = \\frac{1300}{102}\n$$\n\nNow simplify:\n$$\n\\frac{1300}{102} = \\frac{650}{51}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\text{The expected number of adjacent black-black pairs is } \\boxed{\\frac{650}{51}}.\n$$\n\n[OUTPUT] The expected number of adjacent black-black card pairs in a circular arrangement of a standard 52-card deck is $ \\frac{650}{51} $.
