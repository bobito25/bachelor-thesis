However, since $\\mathbf{R}$ is a matrix, the most plausible interpretation is that we are to **apply the reflection matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ to the state of the world**.\n\n5. **Assuming $\\mathbf{n}$**:\n   - Since $\\mathbf{R}$ is $3 \\times 3$, it is likely that $\\mathbf{n}$ is also a 3-dimensional vector.\n   - For simplicity, assume $\\mathbf{n}$ is a vector of arbitrary values, say $\\mathbf{n} = [a, b, c]^T$.\n   - Then, the state of the world is:\n     $$\n     \\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{n} \\mathbf{n}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 & ab & ac \\\\ ab & b^2 & bc \\\\ ac & bc & c^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n     $$\n\n6. **Applying the Reflection Matrix**:\n   - To apply $\\mathbf{R}$ to the state of the world, we perform the matrix multiplication:\n     $$\n     \\mathbf{S}' = \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{S}\n     $$\n   - This will transform the state of the world according to the reflection defined by $\\mathbf{R}$.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The new state of the world is the matrix $\\mathbf{S}' = \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{S}$, where $\\mathbf{S}$ is the outer product of $\\mathbf{n}$ with itself.\n\n[OUTPUT] The state of the world is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix resulting from the reflection matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ applied to the outer product of $\\mathbf{n}$ with itself, i.e., $\\mathbf{S}' = \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{n} \\mathbf{n}^T$.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.\nAfter applying the plan, this is the current state of the world:\nThe state of the world is an $n \\times n$ matrix where each element $(i, j)$ is the product of the $i$-th and $j$-th elements of $\\mathbf{n}$.\nWhat is the state of the world after applying this action?
