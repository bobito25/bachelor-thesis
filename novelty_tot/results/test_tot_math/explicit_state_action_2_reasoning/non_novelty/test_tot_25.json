A polynomial of degree $ n $ is uniquely determined by its values at $ n+1 $ distinct points. Here, we are only specifying values at 3 points, so there may be multiple polynomials of different degrees that pass through these points.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for **how many polynomials $ Q(x) $** exist, not the number of functions. So we need to count the number of **distinct polynomials** $ Q(x) $ that satisfy the condition $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Consider the degree of $ Q(x) $\nIf $ Q(x) $ is a polynomial of degree $ d $, then the values $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $ determine $ Q(x) $ uniquely if $ d \\leq 2 $, because a polynomial of degree $ \\leq 2 $ is determined by its values at 3 distinct points.\n\nIf $ Q(x) $ has degree $ \\geq 3 $, then we cannot determine it uniquely from its values at only 3 points.\n\nSo, the only possible polynomials $ Q(x) $ that satisfy the condition are those of degree at most 2, and that pass through the 3 points $ (1, Q(1)), (2, Q(2)), (3, Q(3)) $, where $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Count the number of such polynomials\nWe now count how many **distinct polynomials** $ Q(x) $ of degree at most 2 satisfy $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\n- There are $ 3^3 = 27 $ possible mappings from $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ to $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n- For each such mapping, there is a unique polynomial $ Q(x) $ of degree at most 2 that passes through the 3 points.\n\nThus, there are **27** such polynomials $ Q(x) $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Confirm that $ R(x) $ is a polynomial of degree 3\nWe are given that $ R(x) $ is of degree 3. Since $ P(x) $ is degree 3 and $ P(Q(x)) $ is a composition of a cubic with a polynomial $ Q(x) $, the degree of $ P(Q(x)) $ will be $ 3 \\cdot \\deg(Q(x)) $. For $ R(x) $ to be of degree 3, we must have:\n$$\n\\deg(P(Q(x))) = \\deg(P(x)) + \\deg(R(x)) = 3 + 3 = 6\n$$\nSo:\n$$\n3 \\cdot \\deg(Q(x)) = 6 \\Rightarrow \\deg(Q(x)) = 2\n$$\n\nThus, $ Q(x) $ must be a **quadratic polynomial**.\n\nWe have already counted all such polynomials of degree at most 2 that pass through the 3 points $ (1, Q(1)), (2, Q(2)), (3, Q(3)) $, and there are **27** of them.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are **27** such polynomials $ Q(x) $.\n\n[FINISHED]", "novelty_summary": null, "children": [], "action": "To solve the problem, we need to find the number of polynomials $ Q(x) $ such that there exists a polynomial $ R(x) $ of degree 3 for which the equation $ P(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x) $ holds, where $ P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the equation\nWe are given:\n$$\nP(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x)\n$$\nwhere:\n- $ P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) $ is a cubic polynomial.\n- $ R(x) $ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n\nThis means $ P(Q(x)) $ is divisible by $ P(x) $, and the quotient $ R(x) $ is a cubic polynomial.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze $ P(Q(x)) $\nLet\u2019s expand $ P(Q(x)) $:\n$$\nP(Q(x)) = (Q(x) - 1)(Q(x) - 2)(Q(x) - 3)\n$$\nWe want this to be divisible by $ P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) $, so that:\n$$\nP(Q(x)) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) \\cdot R(x)\n$$\n\nThis means that $ Q(x) $ must be such that the roots of $ P(x) $, namely $ x = 1, 2, 3 $, are also roots of $ P(Q(x)) $. That is, $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $ must be among the roots of $ P(x) $, which are $ 1, 2, 3 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the constraints on $ Q(x) $\nSince $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $, we are essentially choosing values for $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $ from the set $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\nThus, we are counting the number of functions from the set $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ to the set $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $. Since each of the three inputs can independently map to any of the three outputs, the total number of such mappings is:\n$$\n3^3 = 27\n$$\n\nHowever, we are only interested in those mappings that correspond to polynomials $ Q(x) $, not just arbitrary functions. This is where the problem becomes more nuanced.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Consider the polynomial nature of $ Q(x) $\nWe are looking for polynomials $ Q(x) $ such that $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $. A polynomial of degree $ n $ is uniquely determined by its values at $ n+1 $ distinct points.

Since $ P(x) $ is degree 3 and $ P(Q(x)) $ is a composition of a cubic with a polynomial $ Q(x) $, the degree of $ P(Q(x)) $ will be $ 3 \\cdot \\deg(Q(x)) $. For $ R(x) $ to be of degree 3, we must have:\n$$\n\\deg(P(Q(x))) = \\deg(P(x)) + \\deg(R(x)) = 3 + 3 = 6\n$$\nSo:\n$$\n3 \\cdot \\deg(Q(x)) = 6 \\Rightarrow \\deg(Q(x)) = 2\n$$\n\nThus, $ Q(x) $ must be a **quadratic polynomial**.\n\nWe have already counted all such polynomials of degree at most 2 that pass through the 3 points $ (1, Q(1)), (2, Q(2)), (3, Q(3)) $, and there are **27** of them.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are **27** such polynomials $ Q(x) $.\n\n[FINISHED]", "used_action_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Let $P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$.
