This gives a square of side length 60.\n\n2. **Define the condition for meeting**:  \n   Allen and Bethany will see each other if $ |x - y| \\leq 15 $. This defines a region within the square where their arrival times are close enough for them to meet.\n\n3. **Visualize the region**:  \n   The inequality $ |x - y| \\leq 15 $ represents the area between the lines $ y = x + 15 $ and $ y = x - 15 $ within the square.\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the region**:  \n   The total area of the square is $ 60 \\times 60 = 3600 $ square minutes.\n\n   The region where $ |x - y| \\leq 15 $ consists of a band centered along the diagonal of the square, with width 30 (15 minutes on either side of the diagonal).
