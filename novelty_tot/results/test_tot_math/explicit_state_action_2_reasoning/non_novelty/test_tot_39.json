Divide 3 by 13 to get the decimal representation.\n2. Identify the repeating part of the decimal (the repetend).\n3.

So, we write 0. and bring down a 0 to make 30.\n2. **Divide 30 by 13:** 13 \u00d7 2 = 26, so we write 2. Subtract 26 from 30 to get a remainder of 4.\n3. **Bring down a 0 to make 40.** Divide 40 by 13: 13 \u00d7 3 = 39, so we write 3. Subtract 39 from 40 to get a remainder of 1.\n4. **Bring down a 0 to make 10.** Divide 10 by 13: 13 \u00d7 0 = 0, so we write 0. Subtract 0 from 10 to get a remainder of 10.\n5. **Bring down a 0 to make 100.** Divide 100 by 13: 13 \u00d7 7 = 91, so we write 7. Subtract 91 from 100 to get a remainder of 9.\n6. **Bring down a 0 to make 90.** Divide 90 by 13: 13 \u00d7 6 = 78, so we write 6. Subtract 78 from 90 to get a remainder of 12.\n7. **Bring down a 0 to make 120.** Divide 120 by 13: 13 \u00d7 9 = 117, so we write 9. Subtract 117 from 120 to get a remainder of 3.\n8. **Bring down a 0 to make 30.** This is the same as step 2, so the cycle repeats.\n\n### Decimal representation:\n$$\n\\frac{3}{13} = 0.\\overline{230769}\n$$\n\n### The 6-digit repetend is:\n$$\n230769\n$$\n\n[OUTPUT] The decimal representation of $ \\frac{3}{13} $ is $ 0.\\overline{230769} $, and the 6-digit repetend is **230769**.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Find the 6-digit repetend in the decimal representation of $\\frac 3{13}.$\nWhat is the state of the world after applying this action?
