The given sides are 6 cm and 8 cm. The remaining side could be either the hypotenuse or one of the legs, depending on which side is missing.\n\nTo find the shortest possible length of the remaining side, we need to consider the two cases:\n1. If the given sides (6 cm and 8 cm) are the legs, the hypotenuse can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: $ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $.\n2. If one of the given sides is the hypotenuse, the missing leg can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: $ a = \\sqrt{c^2 - b^2} $.\n\nWe will first calculate the hypotenuse in case the given sides are legs.\n\n[OUTPUT] Calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem: $ c = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} $.\n### Reasoning:\nWe are given a triangle with two sides (6 cm and 8 cm) and a right angle. The triangle is a right triangle, and the Pythagorean theorem applies:  \n$$\nc = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n$$  \nHere, $ a = 6 $, $ b = 8 $, and $ c $ is the hypotenuse. Substituting the values:  \n$$\nc = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n$$  \nThus, the hypotenuse is 10 cm. Since the hypotenuse is always the longest side in a right triangle, the remaining side (the one we are not given) is the one that is not the hypotenuse. However, the question asks for the **shortest possible length** of the remaining side. Since we are given the two sides (6 cm and 8 cm), the remaining side is the hypotenuse, which is 10 cm. Therefore, the **shortest possible length** of the remaining side is **6 cm** (the smaller of the two given sides).\n\n### [OUTPUT]\nThe triangle is a right triangle with side lengths of 6 cm, 8 cm, and 10 cm.
