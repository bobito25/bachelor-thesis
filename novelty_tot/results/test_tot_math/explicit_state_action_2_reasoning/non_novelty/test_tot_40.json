Let's denote the side length of the original tetrahedron as $ a $.\n\n2.

To find the **scaling factor** between the two tetrahedrons, we need to determine the ratio of the edge lengths of the smaller tetrahedron to the original.\n\n   - The edge length of the smaller tetrahedron can be found by calculating the distance between the centroids of two adjacent faces of the original tetrahedron.\n   - This involves using vector geometry or coordinate geometry. If we place the original tetrahedron in 3D space with coordinates, we can compute the coordinates of the centroids of the faces and then find the edge length of the smaller tetrahedron.\n\n5.

The **centers of the four faces** of this tetrahedron are the vertices of a **smaller tetrahedron**. We are to find the **ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to the larger**, and then compute $ m + n $, where the ratio is expressed as $ \\frac{m}{n} $ in lowest terms.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry\n\nLet the original regular tetrahedron have side length $ s $. The **centroid of a face** (an equilateral triangle) lies at a point that is the average of the coordinates of the three vertices of that triangle. The **center of a face** is also the **centroid** of the triangle.\n\nThe smaller tetrahedron formed by the face centroids is **similar** to the original tetrahedron. So, the **volume ratio** is equal to the **cube of the ratio of corresponding edge lengths**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate Setup\n\nTo compute the coordinates of the centroids and the edge length of the smaller tetrahedron, we can place the original tetrahedron in 3D space with convenient coordinates.\n\nLet\u2019s choose coordinates for the original regular tetrahedron such that:\n\n- One vertex is at the origin: $ A = (0, 0, 0) $\n- The second vertex is at $ B = (1, 0, 0) $\n- The third vertex is at $ C = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0\\right) $\n- The fourth vertex is at $ D = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right) $\n\nThese coordinates form a regular tetrahedron with edge length $ s = 1 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Centroids of the Faces\n\nEach face is a triangle. The **centroid** of a triangle with vertices $ (x_1, y_1, z_1), (x_2, y_2, z_2), (x_3, y_3, z_3) $ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3}, \\frac{z_1 + z_2 + z_3}{3} \\right)\n$$\n\nWe compute the centroids for each face:\n\n#### Face $ ABC $:\n- $ A = (0, 0, 0) $\n- $ B = (1, 0, 0) $\n- $ C = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0\\right) $\n\nCentroid:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{0 + 1 + \\frac{1}{2}}{3}, \\frac{0 + 0 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{3}, 0 \\right) = \\left( \\frac{3}{6}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}, 0 \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}, 0 \\right)\n$$\n\n#### Face $ ABD $:\n- $ A = (0, 0, 0) $\n- $ B = (1, 0, 0) $\n- $ D = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right) $\n\nCentroid:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{0 + 1 + \\frac{1}{2}}{3}, \\frac{0 + 0 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}}{3}, \\frac{0 + 0 + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{3}{6}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{18}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{18}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} \\right)\n$$\n\n#### Face $ ACD $:\n- $ A = (0, 0, 0) $\n- $ C = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0\\right) $\n- $ D = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right) $\n\nCentroid:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{0 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}}{3}, \\frac{0 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}}{3}, \\frac{0 + 0 + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{9}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} \\right)\n$$\n\n#### Face $ BCD $:\n- $ B = (1, 0, 0) $\n- $ C = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0\\right) $\n- $ D = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right) $\n\nCentroid:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}}{3}, \\frac{0 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}}{3}, \\frac{0 + 0 + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{9}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} \\right)\n$$\n\nSo, the four centroids are:\n\n1. $ G_1 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}, 0 \\right) $\n2. $ G_2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{18}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} \\right) $\n3. $ G_3 = \\left( \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{9}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} \\right) $\n4. $ G_4 = \\left( \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{9}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} \\right) $\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Edge Length of the Smaller Tetrahedron\n\nWe compute the distance between two centroids, say $ G_1 $ and $ G_2 $:\n\n$$\nd = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{18} \\right)^2 + \\left( 0 - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} \\right)^2 }\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\sqrt{ 0 + \\left( \\frac{3\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{3}}{18} \\right)^2 + \\left( -\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} \\right)^2 }\n= \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{18} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} \\right)^2 }\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{9} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} \\right)^2 }\n= \\sqrt{ \\frac{3}{81} + \\frac{6}{81} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{9}{81} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{9} } = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\nSo, the **edge length of the smaller tetrahedron is $ \\frac{1}{3} $** of the original.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Volume Ratio\n\nSince the smaller tetrahedron is similar to the original, and the edge lengths are in the ratio $ \\frac{1}{3} $, the **volume ratio is**:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\n$$\n\nThus, $ m = 1 $, $ n = 27 $, and $ m + n = 28 $.\n\n---\n\n[OUTPUT] The volume of the smaller tetrahedron is $ \\frac{1}{27} $ that of the original, so the sum $ m + n = 28 $.
