One efficient approach is to iterate through all possible values of $ a + b $ and count the number of digit pairs $ (a, b) $ and $ (c, d) $ that sum to the same value, then multiply the counts for each sum.\n\n[OUTPUT] Compute the number of balanced integers by iterating through all 4-digit numbers and checking if the sum of the first two digits equals the sum of the last two digits.\nTo solve the problem of counting how many 4-digit integers between 1000 and 9999 are **balanced** (i.e., the sum of the first two digits equals the sum of the last two digits), we can proceed in the following small steps:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the range\nWe are dealing with 4-digit numbers from 1000 to 9999, inclusive. This gives us a total of:\n$$\n9999 - 1000 + 1 = 9000 \\text{ numbers}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Define a balanced number\nA number is **balanced** if the sum of its **first two digits** equals the sum of its **last two digits**.\n\nFor a number $ N = abcd $ (where $ a, b, c, d $ are digits), the number is balanced if:\n$$\na + b = c + d\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Iterate through all 4-digit numbers\nWe can iterate from 1000 to 9999, and for each number, extract its digits and check the condition:\n$$\na + b = c + d\n$$\n\nThis can be done programmatically or manually by counting how many combinations of digits satisfy the condition.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of balanced numbers\nInstead of iterating through all 9000 numbers, we can count the number of valid combinations of digits that satisfy the condition $ a + b = c + d $, with the constraint that $ a \\geq 1 $ (since $ a $ is the first digit of a 4-digit number).\n\nLet\u2019s consider all possible values for the sum $ s = a + b = c + d $, where $ s $ ranges from 1 to 18 (since the maximum sum of two digits is $ 9 + 9 = 18 $).\n\nWe calculate how many pairs of digits (for the first two digits and the last two digits) sum to each $ s $, and then count the number of combinations that match.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- $ f(s) $: number of 2-digit combinations (digits can be from 0 to 9) that sum to $ s $\n- $ g(s) $: number of 2-digit combinations where the first digit is at least 1 (i.e., the first two digits of a 4-digit number), and the two digits sum to $ s $\n\nWe compute $ f(s) $ for all $ s $ from 1 to 18, and then compute $ g(s) $ for the same range (but with the first digit of the pair $ \\geq 1 $).\n\nFinally, the number of balanced numbers is:\n$$\n\\sum_{s=1}^{18} g(s) \\times f(s)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute the result\nWe compute the values:\n\n- $ f(1) = 1 $, $ f(2) = 2 $, ..., $ f(9) = 9 $, $ f(10) = 9 $, $ f(11) = 8 $, ..., $ f(18) = 1 $\n- $ g(s) $ is similar to $ f(s) $, but with the restriction that the first digit $ \\geq 1 $. So for $ s \\geq 1 $, $ g(s) = f(s) $, but subtract the case where the first digit is 0 (which is not valid for the first two digits of a 4-digit number).\n\nAfter computing all the values, the total number of balanced numbers is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{615}\n$$\n\n---\n\n[OUTPUT] The number of balanced integers between 1000 and 9999 is **615**.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.An integer between $1000$ and $9999$, inclusive, is called balanced if the sum of its two leftmost digits equals the sum of its two rightmost digits.
