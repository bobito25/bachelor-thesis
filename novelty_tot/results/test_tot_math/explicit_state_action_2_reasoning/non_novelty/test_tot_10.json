This is a reasonable assumption to simplify the problem and test for symmetry.\n\nSubstitute $ a = b $ into the expression:\n\n$$\n\\frac{(a^2 + a^2)^2}{a^3 a} = \\frac{(2a^2)^2}{a^4} = \\frac{4a^4}{a^4} = 4\n$$\n\nSo, the value is $ 4 $ when $ a = b $.\n\nWe now need to determine whether this is the **minimum** value.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Try to prove that the minimum is 4\n\nLet\u2019s consider the general expression again:\n\n$$\n\\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{a^3 b}\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s use **AM-GM inequality**. We know that:\n\n$$\na^2 + b^2 \\geq 2ab\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\n(a^2 + b^2)^2 \\geq (2ab)^2 = 4a^2b^2\n$$\n\nNow, plug this into the original expression:\n\n$$\n\\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{a^3 b} \\geq \\frac{4a^2b^2}{a^3 b} = \\frac{4b^2}{a b} = \\frac{4b}{a}\n$$\n\nThis gives a **lower bound** of $ \\frac{4b}{a} $, which depends on the ratio $ \\frac{b}{a} $. So, this approach is not tight enough to find the **minimum**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use substitution $ x = \\frac{a}{b} $, then express everything in terms of $ x $\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{a}{b} \\Rightarrow a = xb\n$$\n\nNow substitute into the original expression:\n\n$$\n\\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{a^3 b} = \\frac{((xb)^2 + b^2)^2}{(xb)^3 b} = \\frac{(x^2b^2 + b^2)^2}{x^3b^3 b}\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{(b^2(x^2 + 1))^2}{x^3b^4} = \\frac{b^4(x^2 + 1)^2}{x^3b^4} = \\frac{(x^2 + 1)^2}{x^3}\n$$\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{(x^2 + 1)^2}{x^3}, \\quad x > 0\n$$\n\nNow, we minimize $ f(x) $ over $ x > 0 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Minimize $ f(x) = \\frac{(x^2 + 1)^2}{x^3} $\n\nTake the derivative of $ f(x) $:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{(x^2 + 1)^2}{x^3}\n$$\n\nUse the quotient rule:\n\nLet $ u = (x^2 + 1)^2 $, $ v = x^3 $\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}\n$$\n\nCompute $ u' $ and $ v' $:\n\n- $ u = (x^2 + 1)^2 \\Rightarrow u' = 2(x^2 + 1)(2x) = 4x(x^2 + 1) $\n- $ v = x^3 \\Rightarrow v' = 3x^2 $\n\nNow plug in:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{4x(x^2 + 1)(x^3) - (x^2 + 1)^2(3x^2)}{x^6}\n$$\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n$$\nx^2(x^2 + 1)[4x^2 - 3(x^2 + 1)] = x^2(x^2 + 1)[4x^2 - 3x^2 - 3] = x^2(x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 3)\n$$\n\nSet $ f'(x) = 0 $:\n\n$$\nx^2(x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 3) = 0\n$$\n\nSince $ x > 0 $, $ x^2 + 1 > 0 $, and $ x^2 \\neq 0 $, the only critical point is when:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate $ f(x) $ at $ x = \\sqrt{3} $\n\n$$\nf(\\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{((\\sqrt{3})^2 + 1)^2}{(\\sqrt{3})^3} = \\frac{(3 + 1)^2}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{16}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{9}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{9}}\n$$\n\n[OUTPUT] $\\boxed{\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{9}}$\nTo find the minimum value of  \n$$\n\\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{a^3 b}\n$$  \nfor positive real numbers $a$ and $b$, we proceed in small steps:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Use symmetry and substitution\nLet\u2019s assume $a = b$ to test for symmetry. This is a common technique to simplify expressions.\n\nSet $a = b = x$, where $x > 0$.\n\nSubstitute into the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{(x^2 + x^2)^2}{x^3 \\cdot x} = \\frac{(2x^2)^2}{x^4} = \\frac{4x^4}{x^4} = 4\n$$\n\nSo the expression evaluates to 4 when $a = b$. But is this the **minimum**?\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the AM-GM inequality\nWe now attempt to minimize the original expression:\n$$\n\\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{a^3 b}\n$$\n\nUse the AM-GM inequality on $a^2 + b^2$:\n$$\na^2 + b^2 \\geq 2ab\n$$\nSo,\n$$\n(a^2 + b^2)^2 \\geq (2ab)^2 = 4a^2b^2\n$$\n\nNow plug into the original expression:\n$$\n\\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{a^3 b} \\geq \\frac{4a^2b^2}{a^3 b} = \\frac{4b^2}{a b} = \\frac{4b}{a}\n$$\n\nSo we now have:\n$$\n\\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{a^3 b} \\geq \\frac{4b}{a}\n$$\n\nNow minimize $\\frac{4b}{a}$. This is minimized when $a$ is maximized and $b$ is minimized. However, we need to find the **true minimum** of the original expression.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use calculus to minimize the function\nLet\u2019s define the function:\n$$\nf(a, b) = \\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{a^3 b}\n$$\n\nTake partial derivatives with respect to $a$ and $b$ and set them to zero to find critical points.\n\nAlternatively, use the substitution $b = ka$, where $k > 0$, to reduce the expression to one variable.\n\nLet $b = ka$, then:\n$$\nf(a, ka) = \\frac{(a^2 + (ka)^2)^2}{a^3 (ka)} = \\frac{(1 + k^2)^2 a^4}{k a^4} = \\frac{(1 + k^2)^2}{k}\n$$\n\nNow minimize:\n$$\nf(k) = \\frac{(1 + k^2)^2}{k}\n$$\n\nTake derivative with respect to $k$:\n$$\nf'(k) = \\frac{2(1 + k^2)(2k) \\cdot k - (1 + k^2)^2}{k^2}\n$$\n\nSet $f'(k) = 0$:\n$$\n2k(1 + k^2)(2k) - (1 + k^2)^2 = 0\n$$\n\nFactor:\n$$\n(1 + k^2)(4k^2 - (1 + k^2)) = 0\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n$$\n(1 + k^2)(4k^2 - 1 - k^2) = (1 + k^2)(3k^2 - 1) = 0\n$$\n\nSince $1 + k^2 > 0$, set $3k^2 - 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow k^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\Rightarrow k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nSo the minimum occurs at $k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Plug back in to find the minimum value\n$$\nf(k) = \\frac{(1 + k^2)^2}{k} = \\frac{(1 + \\frac{1}{3})^2}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{9}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{16}{9} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{9}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{9}}\n$$\n\n[OUTPUT] The minimum value of the expression $\\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{a^3 b}$ for positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{9}}$.
