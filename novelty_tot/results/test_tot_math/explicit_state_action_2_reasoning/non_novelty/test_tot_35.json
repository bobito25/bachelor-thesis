Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Understand the definition of a proper divisor**: A proper divisor of a number is a divisor other than 1 and the number itself.\n2. **Check for \"nice\" numbers**:\n   - For each number starting from 2, find its proper divisors.\n   - Compute the product of these proper divisors.\n   - If the product equals the number, it is \"nice.\"\n3. **Continue this process** until we find the first ten such numbers.\n4. **Sum the first ten nice numbers**.\n\nWe will start by checking numbers sequentially and determining if they are nice.\n\n[OUTPUT] Check numbers sequentially starting from 2 to find the first ten \"nice\" numbers.\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the first ten \"nice\" numbers. A number is \"nice\" if it is equal to the product of its **distinct proper divisors** (excluding 1 and the number itself). Let's break it down step by step:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand Proper Divisors\nA **proper divisor** of a number is a positive integer that divides the number exactly, excluding the number itself and 1. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 2 and 3.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Define a \"Nice\" Number\nA number is \"nice\" if it is equal to the **product** of its **distinct proper divisors**. For example:\n- 6 has proper divisors {2, 3}, and 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 \u2192 6 is a \"nice\" number.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find the First Ten Nice Numbers\nWe now check numbers sequentially to find the first ten \"nice\" numbers.\n\n#### 1. Number = 6\n- Proper divisors: 2, 3\n- Product: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- \u2705 6 is nice\n\n#### 2. Number = 8\n- Proper divisors: 2, 4\n- Product: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n- \u2705 8 is nice\n\n#### 3. Number = 10\n- Proper divisors: 2, 5\n- Product: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- \u2705 10 is nice\n\n#### 4. Number = 14\n- Proper divisors: 2, 7\n- Product: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- \u2705 14 is nice\n\n#### 5. Number = 15\n- Proper divisors: 3, 5\n- Product: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n- \u2705 15 is nice\n\n#### 6. Number = 21\n- Proper divisors: 3, 7\n- Product: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n- \u2705 21 is nice\n\n#### 7. Number = 22\n- Proper divisors: 2, 11\n- Product: 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n- \u2705 22 is nice\n\n#### 8. Number = 26\n- Proper divisors: 2, 13\n- Product: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n- \u2705 26 is nice\n\n#### 9. Number = 27\n- Proper divisors: 3, 9\n- Product: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n- \u2705 27 is nice\n\n#### 10. Number = 33\n- Proper divisors: 3, 11\n- Product: 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n- \u2705 33 is nice\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Add the First Ten Nice Numbers\nNow, sum the first ten nice numbers:\n$$\n6 + 8 + 10 + 14 + 15 + 21 + 22 + 26 + 27 + 33 = 192\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n[OUTPUT] The sum of the first ten nice numbers is **192**.
