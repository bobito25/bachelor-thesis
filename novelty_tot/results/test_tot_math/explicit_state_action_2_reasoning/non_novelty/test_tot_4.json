So, all three values $a_5, b_5, c_5$ must be \u2264 3, and **at least one of each pair must be equal to 3**.\n\nLet\u2019s count the number of such triples $(a_5, b_5, c_5)$ where:\n\n- $a_5, b_5, c_5 \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$\n- $\\max(a_5, b_5) = 3$\n- $\\max(b_5, c_5) = 3$\n- $\\max(c_5, a_5) = 3$\n\nThis means that **all three values must be \u2264 3**, and **each pair must have at least one value equal to 3**.\n\nThis implies that **at least two of the values must be 3**, and the third can be anything from 0 to 3.\n\nSo, let\u2019s count the number of such triples:\n\n- Choose which two of $(a_5, b_5, c_5)$ are equal to 3 (3 choices)\n- The third value can be any of $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ \u2192 4 choices\n\nSo total number of such triples = $3 \\times 4 = 12$\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Total Number of Ordered Triples $(a,b,c)$\n\nNow we multiply the number of valid exponent combinations:\n\n- 7 combinations for $(a_2, b_2, c_2)$\n- 12 combinations for $(a_5, b_5, c_5)$\n\nSo, the total number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ is:\n\n$$\n7 \\times 12 = 84\n$$\n\n---\n\n### [OUTPUT] The number of ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ that satisfy the given LCM conditions is **84**.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Let $[r,s]$ denote the least common multiple of positive integers $r$ and $s$.

Also, from the second condition, at least one of $x_2$ or $x_3$ must be 4. Since $x_3$ is already required to be 4 or more (from the last condition), this is satisfied.\n\nNow, from the first condition $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$, both $x_1$ and $x_2$ must be \u2264 3. But from the second condition, $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$, so $x_3 = 4$, and $x_2 \\leq 3$.\n\nThus, the only possibility is:\n- $x_3 = 4$\n- $x_1 \\leq 3$\n- $x_2 \\leq 3$\n\nNow, from $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$, since $x_3 = 4$, this is satisfied.\n\nSo, the values of $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are:\n- $x_3 = 4$\n- $x_1, x_2 \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$\n\nNow consider the powers of 5 (i.e., $y_1, y_2, y_3$):\n\nFrom the given:\n- $\\max(y_1, y_2) = 3$\n- $\\max(y_2, y_3) = 3$\n- $\\max(y_3, y_1) = 3$\n\nThis implies that all three $y_1, y_2, y_3$ must be \u2264 3, and at least one of them must be 3.\n\nSo, the values of $y_1, y_2, y_3$ must be in $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, and at least one of them must be 3.\n\n### Step 5: Count Valid Triples\n#### Counting $x_1, x_2, x_3$:\n- $x_3 = 4$ (fixed)\n- $x_1, x_2 \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ \u2192 4 choices for $x_1$, 4 choices for $x_2$\n\nSo, there are $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$ valid combinations for $x_1, x_2, x_3$.\n\n#### Counting $y_1, y_2, y_3$:\nWe need to count the number of ordered triples $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ such that:\n- $y_1, y_2, y_3 \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$\n- $\\max(y_1, y_2, y_3) = 3$\n\nThis is equivalent to counting all triples in $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}^3$ that include at least one 3.\n\n- Total number of such triples: $4^3 = 64$\n- Number of such triples that **do not** include any 3: $3^3 = 27$\n- So, the number of triples with at least one 3: $64 - 27 = 37$\n\n### Step 6: Total Number of Valid Triples\nEach valid combination of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ can be combined with each valid combination of $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$, so the total number of valid $(a, b, c)$ is:\n\n$$\n16 \\cdot 37 = 592\n$$\n\n### Final Answer\n[OUTPUT] 592\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the number of ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers such that:\n\n- $[a, b] = 1000$\n- $[b, c] = 2000$\n- $[c, a] = 2000$\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization\nWe begin by factoring the numbers involved:\n\n- $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$\n- $2000 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3$\n\nWe will represent $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of their prime factorizations:\n\nLet:\n- $a = 2^{x_1} \\cdot 5^{y_1}$\n- $b = 2^{x_2} \\cdot 5^{y_2}$\n- $c = 2^{x_3} \\cdot 5^{y_3}$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the LCM Condition\n\nRecall that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the maximum exponent for each prime:\n\n- $[a, b] = 2^{\\max(x_1, x_2)} \\cdot 5^{\\max(y_1, y_2)} = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$\n- $[b, c] = 2^{\\max(x_2, x_3)} \\cdot 5^{\\max(y_2, y_3)} = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3$\n- $[c, a] = 2^{\\max(x_3, x_1)} \\cdot 5^{\\max(y_3, y_1)} = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3$\n\nThis gives us the following constraints:\n\n#### For the power of 2:\n- $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$\n- $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$\n- $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$\n\n#### For the power of 5:\n- $\\max(y_1, y_2) = 3$\n- $\\max(y_2, y_3) = 3$\n- $\\max(y_3, y_1) = 3$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Constraints\n\n#### For the powers of 2:\n\nFrom $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$, at least one of $x_1$ or $x_2$ is 3, and both are $\\leq 3$.\n\nFrom $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$, at least one of $x_2$ or $x_3$ is 4, and both are $\\leq 4$.\n\nFrom $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$, at least one of $x_3$ or $x_1$ is 4, and both are $\\leq 4$.\n\nThis gives us the following:\n\n- $x_2 \\leq 3$, since $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$\n- So $x_3 = 4$ (since $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$ and $x_2 \\leq 3$)\n- Similarly, $x_1 = 4$ (since $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$ and $x_3 = 4$)\n\nNow, $x_1 = 4$, $x_3 = 4$, and $x_2 \\leq 3$\n\nSo the possible values for $x_2$ are $0, 1, 2, 3$ (4 choices).\n\n#### For the powers of 5:\n\nFrom $\\max(y_1, y_2) = 3$, $\\max(y_2, y_3) = 3$, $\\max(y_3, y_1) = 3$, we get that:\n\n- $y_1, y_2, y_3 \\leq 3$\n- At least one of $y_1, y_2$ is 3\n- At least one of $y_2, y_3$ is 3\n- At least one of $y_3, y_1$ is 3\n\nThis implies that at least two of $y_1, y_2, y_3$ must be 3, and the third can be anything up to 3.\n\nLet\u2019s count the number of such triples $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ such that $\\max(y_1, y_2, y_3) = 3$ and $\\max(y_i, y_j) = 3$ for each pair.\n\nThere are $4^3 = 64$ total combinations of $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ with each $y_i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$.\n\nNow, subtract the ones where $\\max(y_1, y_2, y_3) < 3$, i.e., all $y_i \\leq 2$. That gives $3^3 = 27$ such triples.\n\nSo, the number of valid $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ is:\n$$\n64 - 27 = 37\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Total Number of Triples\n\n- There are 4 choices for $x_2$\n- There are 37 valid combinations for $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$\n\nEach choice of $x_2$ and $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ gives a unique triple $(a, b, c)$, since:\n\n- $x_1 = 4$, $x_3 = 4$\n- $y_1, y_2, y_3$ are fixed for each case\n\nThus, the total number of ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ is:\n\n$$\n4 \\times 37 = 148\n$$\n\n---\n\n[OUTPUT] The number of ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ such that $[a, b] = 1000$, $[b, c] = 2000$, and $[c, a] = 2000$ is **148**.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Let $[r,s]$ denote the least common multiple of positive integers $r$ and $s$.
