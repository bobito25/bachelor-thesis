Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. A cube has 6 faces and 8 vertices.\n2. Each face is assigned a different integer, say $ a, b, c, d, e, f $.\n3. Each vertex is the sum of the integers on the three adjacent faces.\n4. Since each face is adjacent to 4 vertices, each face's value will be counted 4 times in the total sum of all vertex values.\n\nThus, the final sum of all vertex values is:\n$$\n4(a + b + c + d + e + f)\n$$\n\nThis means that the final sum is always a multiple of 4, regardless of the values of $ a, b, c, d, e, f $.\n\nTherefore, the largest number that must divide the final sum for every possible numbering of the faces is **4**.\n\n[OUTPUT] The largest number that must divide the final sum for every possible numbering of the faces is 4.\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down into small steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the cube structure**: A cube has 6 faces and 8 vertices. Each vertex is the meeting point of 3 faces.\n\n2. **Assigning integers to faces**: Each face is assigned a different integer. Let\u2019s denote the integers assigned to the faces as $ a, b, c, d, e, f $.\n\n3. **Assigning vertex values**: Each vertex is assigned the sum of the integers on the 3 faces that meet at that vertex.\n\n4. **Adding all vertex values**: The final sum is the sum of all 8 vertex values.\n\nNow, observe the following:\n\n- Each face of the cube is shared by exactly 3 vertices. Thus, each face's integer value is included in the sum of 3 different vertices.\n\n- Therefore, the total sum of all vertex values will be equal to $ 3(a + b + c + d + e + f) $, since each face value is counted exactly 3 times.\n\n- The total sum is always a multiple of 3, and since the sum of the face values can be any integer (depending on the assignment), the only guaranteed divisor of the total sum is 3.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the **largest** number that **must** divide the final sum for **every possible numbering** of the faces. Since the sum is $ 3(a + b + c + d + e + f) $, and the sum $ a + b + c + d + e + f $ is an integer, the sum is always a multiple of 3. But the sum can be **any multiple of 3**, depending on the values of the faces. So 3 is the **largest** number that **must** divide the final sum for **every possible numbering** of the faces.\n\n[OUTPUT] The largest number that must divide the final sum for every possible numbering of the faces is 3.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Each face of a cube is assigned a different integer.
