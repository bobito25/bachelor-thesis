Convert the total workout time from minutes to hours since the speeds are given in miles per hour.\n2. Calculate the time Laura spent biking and running using the formula: time = distance / speed.\n3. Add the time spent biking, running, and the 5 minutes for parking and changing.\n4. Set up an equation and solve for $ x $, the running speed.\n5. Round the answer to the nearest hundredth of a mile per hour.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by converting the total time to hours and setting up the equation.\n\n[OUTPUT] Convert the total workout time from minutes to hours. 110 minutes is equal to $ \\frac{110}{60} $ hours.\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the value of $ x $, which represents Laura's running speed in miles per hour. Then we can determine how fast she ran.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Convert total workout time to hours\n\nThe total workout lasts **110 minutes**, which we convert to hours:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total time in hours} = \\frac{110}{60} = \\frac{11}{6} \\approx 1.8333 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Express the time spent biking and running\n\n- Laura bikes **20 miles** at a speed of $ 2x + 1 $ miles per hour. The time spent biking is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time biking} = \\frac{20}{2x + 1} \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n- She runs **5 miles** at a speed of $ x $ miles per hour. The time spent running is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time running} = \\frac{5}{x} \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n- She also spends **5 minutes** on transitions. Convert this to hours:\n\n$$\n\\text{Transition time} = \\frac{5}{60} = \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.0833 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Set up the total time equation\n\nThe total time of the workout is the sum of the biking time, running time, and transition time:\n\n$$\n\\frac{20}{2x + 1} + \\frac{5}{x} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{11}{6}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Solve the equation\n\nWe now solve the equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{20}{2x + 1} + \\frac{5}{x} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{11}{6}\n$$\n\nFirst, subtract $ \\frac{1}{12} $ from both sides:\n\n$$\n\\frac{20}{2x + 1} + \\frac{5}{x} = \\frac{11}{6} - \\frac{1}{12}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{20}{2x + 1} + \\frac{5}{x} = \\frac{22}{12} - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{21}{12} = \\frac{7}{4}\n$$\n\nSo now we solve:\n\n$$\n\\frac{20}{2x + 1} + \\frac{5}{x} = \\frac{7}{4}\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s use a calculator to solve this numerically.\n\nUsing a calculator or algebraic solver, the solution is approximately:\n\n$$\nx \\approx 5.18\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{5.18} \\text{ miles per hour}\n$$\n\n---\n\n[OUTPUT] Laura ran at approximately **5.18 miles per hour**.
