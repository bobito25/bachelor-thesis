Here\u2019s how we can proceed:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry\n- A **regular tetrahedron** has four equilateral triangular faces.\n- The **center of a face** (centroid) of an equilateral triangle lies at a distance of $ \\frac{1}{3} $ of the height from each side.\n- The smaller tetrahedron formed by the centroids of the four faces is **similar** to the original tetrahedron.\n\n### Step 2: Use Similarity\n- If two tetrahedrons are similar, the ratio of their volumes is the **cube** of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.\n- So, we need to find the ratio of the side length of the smaller tetrahedron to the original.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Side Length Ratio\n- The side length of the smaller tetrahedron is the distance between the centroids of two adjacent faces of the original tetrahedron.\n- This distance is a known geometric property of a regular tetrahedron and is $ \\frac{1}{3} $ of the original side length.\n- So, the ratio of the side lengths is $ \\frac{1}{3} $.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Volume Ratio\n- The volume ratio is $ \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27} $.\n- Thus, the ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to the original is $ \\frac{1}{27} $.\n\n### Step 5: Compute $ m + n $\n- Here, $ m = 1 $, $ n = 27 $, so $ m + n = 28 $.\n\n[OUTPUT] The answer is $ \\boxed{28} $.\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the geometry of a regular tetrahedron and the smaller tetrahedron formed by the centers of its faces.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of a regular tetrahedron\nA **regular tetrahedron** has:\n- 4 equilateral triangular faces\n- 4 vertices\n- 6 equal edges\n\nThe **center of a face** of a regular tetrahedron is the **centroid** of that triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Coordinates of a regular tetrahedron\nWe can place a regular tetrahedron in 3D space with vertices at:\n- $ A = (1, 1, 1) $\n- $ B = (1, -1, -1) $\n- $ C = (-1, 1, -1) $\n- $ D = (-1, -1, 1) $\n\nThese coordinates are chosen so that the tetrahedron is regular and centered at the origin.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute the centroid of each face\nEach face is a triangle, and the **centroid** of a triangle with vertices $ P, Q, R $ is:\n$$\n\\text{Centroid} = \\frac{P + Q + R}{3}\n$$\n\nWe compute the centroids of the four faces:\n\n#### Face $ ABC $:\n$$\n\\text{Centroid} = \\frac{(1,1,1) + (1,-1,-1) + (-1,1,-1)}{3} = \\frac{(1,1,1) + (1,-1,-1) + (-1,1,-1)}{3} = \\frac{(1,1,-1)}{3}\n$$\n\n#### Face $ ABD $:\n$$\n\\text{Centroid} = \\frac{(1,1,1) + (1,-1,-1) + (-1,-1,1)}{3} = \\frac{(1, -1, 1)}{3}\n$$\n\n#### Face $ ACD $:\n$$\n\\text{Centroid} = \\frac{(1,1,1) + (-1,1,-1) + (-1,-1,1)}{3} = \\frac{(-1,1,1)}{3}\n$$\n\n#### Face $ BCD $:\n$$\n\\text{Centroid} = \\frac{(1,-1,-1) + (-1,1,-1) + (-1,-1,1)}{3} = \\frac{(-1,-1, -1)}{3}\n$$\n\nSo the four centroids (vertices of the smaller tetrahedron) are:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3} \\right), \\left( \\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3} \\right), \\left( -\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3} \\right), \\left( -\\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3} \\right)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute the edge length of the smaller tetrahedron\nTake the distance between two vertices of the smaller tetrahedron, e.g., between:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\text{ and } \\left( \\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3} \\right)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{1}{3} -

(-1))^2 + (1 - (-1))^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 4 + 4} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nSo the **edge length** of the larger tetrahedron is $ 2\\sqrt{2} $\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Compute the volume ratio\nThe volume of a regular tetrahedron is proportional to the **cube of the edge length**.\n\nSo the ratio of the volumes is:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\text{edge length of smaller}}{\\text{edge length of larger}} \\right)^3 = \\left( \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}/3}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^3 = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\n$$\n\nSo the **ratio of the volume of the smaller to the larger** is $ \\frac{1}{27} $\n\nThus, $ m = 1 $, $ n = 27 $, and $ m + n = \\boxed{28} $\n\n---\n\n[OUTPUT] The volume ratio of the smaller tetrahedron to the larger is $ \\frac{1}{27} $, so the sum $ m + n = \\boxed{28} $.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.In a regular tetrahedron the centers of the four faces are the vertices of a smaller tetrahedron.
