The triangle has a right angle, so the Pythagorean theorem applies:  \n$$\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n$$  \nwhere $ c $ is the hypotenuse (the longest side), and $ a $, $ b $ are the other two sides.\n\nWe are not told which of the given sides is the hypotenuse, so we need to consider both possibilities:\n\n### Case 1: 8 cm is the hypotenuse\nIf 8 cm is the hypotenuse, then the other two sides are 6 cm and the unknown side $ x $. Applying the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$\n6^2 + x^2 = 8^2\n$$\n$$\n36 + x^2 = 64\n$$\n$$\nx^2 = 64 - 36 = 28\n$$\n$$\nx = \\sqrt{28} \\approx 5.29\n$$\n\n### Case 2: 6 cm is the hypotenuse\nIf 6 cm is the hypotenuse, then the other two sides are 8 cm and the unknown side $ x $. Applying the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$\nx^2 + 8^2 = 6^2\n$$\n$$\nx^2 + 64 = 36\n$$\n$$\nx^2 = 36 - 64 = -28\n$$\nThis is not possible because the square of a real number cannot be negative. Therefore, 6 cm cannot be the hypotenuse.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid case is when 8 cm is the hypotenuse, and the unknown side is approximately 5.29 cm.\n\n[OUTPUT] The shortest possible length of the remaining side is **5.29 cm**.\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the triangle with the given information:\n\n- Two sides are 6 cm and 8 cm.\n- There is a right angle.\n\nThis triangle is a **right triangle**, and the side lengths must satisfy the **Pythagorean Theorem**:  \n$$\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n$$\n\n### Step 1: Identify the roles of the sides\nWe are told that the triangle has a right angle, so the side opposite the right angle is the **hypotenuse**, and the other two are **legs**.\n\nWe are to find the **shortest possible length** of the **remaining side**. This means we must consider **two cases**:\n1. The side of 8 cm is the hypotenuse.\n2. The side of 6 cm is the hypotenuse.\n\nWe will test both and find the **shortest possible length** of the remaining side.\n\n---\n\n### Case 1: 8 cm is the hypotenuse\nWe are given:\n- One leg = 6 cm\n- Hypotenuse = 8 cm\n\nUse the Pythagorean Theorem to find the second leg:\n$$\nx^2 + 6^2 = 8^2 \\Rightarrow x^2 + 36 = 64 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 28 \\Rightarrow x = \\sqrt{28} \\approx 5.29\n$$\n\nSo the remaining side is approximately **5.29 cm**.\n\n---\n\n### Case 2: 6 cm is the hypotenuse\nWe are given:\n- One leg = 8 cm\n- Hypotenuse = 6 cm\n\nThis is **not possible**, because the hypotenuse must be **longer than either leg** in a right triangle. So this case is **invalid**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe **shortest possible length** of the remaining side is **5.29 cm**.\n\n[OUTPUT] The triangle has sides of 6 cm, 8 cm, and approximately 5.29 cm, with the right angle between the sides of 6 cm and 5.29 cm.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.A triangle has a side of length 6 cm, a side of length 8 cm and a right angle.
