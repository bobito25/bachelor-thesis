This involves analyzing the overlap of their time intervals at the party.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Define the time interval:**  \n   Both Allen and Bethany arrive at a random time between 1:00 and 2:00 (i.e., between 0 and 60 minutes after 1:00). Let their arrival times be $ x $ and $ y $, respectively, where $ x, y \\in [0, 60] $.\n\n2. **Condition for meeting:**  \n   They will see each other if their time intervals at the party overlap. Since each stays for 15 minutes, Allen is at the party from $ x $ to $ x + 15 $, and Bethany is at the party from $ y $ to $ y + 15 $.  \n   They will meet if:\n   $$\n   |x - y| < 15\n   $$\n   That is, the difference between their arrival times is less than 15 minutes.\n\n3. **Geometric interpretation:**  \n   This is a classic \"probability of overlap\" problem, which can be visualized as a square in the coordinate plane with side length 60 (representing all possible combinations of $ x $ and $ y $). The condition $ |x - y| < 15 $ defines a band around the diagonal of the square.\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the region where they meet:**  \n   The total area of the square is $ 60 \\times 60 = 3600 $. The area where $ |x - y| < 15 $ corresponds to a band around the diagonal of the square. The area of this band is:\n   $$\n   3600 - 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times (60 - 15) \\times (60 - 15) = 3600 - 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 45 \\times 45 = 3600 - 2025 = 1575\n   $$\n\n5. **Calculate the probability:**  \n   The probability that Allen and Bethany see each other is the ratio of the area where they meet to the total area:\n   $$\n   \\frac{1575}{3600} = \\frac{7}{16}\n   $$\n\n### [OUTPUT] The probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party is $ \\frac{7}{16} $.\nTo solve the problem of finding the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party, we can model the situation geometrically.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define Variables**\nLet:\n- $ x $ be the time Allen arrives (in minutes after 1:00).\n- $ y $ be the time Bethany arrives (in minutes after 1:00).\n\nBoth $ x $ and $ y $ are uniformly distributed between 0 and 60 minutes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Condition for Meeting**\nAllen and Bethany will see each other if their time intervals at the party overlap. This happens when:\n$$\n|x - y| < 15\n$$\nThis inequality represents that the difference between their arrival times is less than 15 minutes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Visualize the Problem**\nWe can visualize the problem on a coordinate plane where the x-axis represents Allen\u2019s arrival time and the y-axis represents Bethany\u2019s arrival time. The total possible outcomes are represented by a square with side length 60 (from 0 to 60 minutes), so the total area is:\n$$\n60 \\times 60 = 3600\n$$\n\nThe condition $ |x - y| < 15 $ corresponds to the area between the lines $ y = x + 15 $ and $ y = x - 15 $, within the square.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Compute the Favorable Area**\nThe favorable region is the area of the square between the two lines $ y = x + 15 $ and $ y = x - 15 $, excluding the two triangles outside this band.\n\n- The total area of the square is $ 3600 $.\n- The area of each triangle outside the band is:\n$$\n\\text{Area of triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 45 \\times 45 = 1012.5\n$$\n- So, the total area of the two triangles is:\n$$\n2 \\times 1012.5 = 2025\n$$\n- Therefore, the favorable area is:\n$$\n3600 - 2025 = 1575\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Compute the Probability**\nThe probability is the ratio of the favorable area to the total area:\n$$\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{1575}{3600} = \\frac{7}{16}\n$$\n\n---\n\n[OUTPUT] The probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party is $ \\frac{7}{16} $.

Let's define the time Allen arrives as $ x $ and the time Bethany arrives as $ y $, where both $ x $ and $ y $ are measured in minutes after 1:00 and are between 0 and 60. Allen and Bethany will see each other if the difference between their arrival times is less than or equal to 15 minutes (i.e., $ |x - y| \\leq 15 $).\n\nWe can represent this condition on a coordinate plane with $ x $ and $ y $ as axes, both ranging from 0 to 60.

The area of the region where $ |x - y| \\leq 15 $ is the area of the square minus the area of the two triangles outside this region.

Both times are measured in minutes after 1:00, so they can range from 0 to 60 minutes.\n\n### Step 1: Define the sample space\nThe total possible combinations of arrival times for Allen and Bethany form a square with side length 60, representing all possible (x, y) pairs. The total area of this square is:\n$$\n60 \\times 60 = 3600\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Define the condition for them to see each other\nThey will see each other if the difference between their arrival times is less than or equal to 15 minutes (i.e., they overlap in time). This means:\n$$\n|x - y| \\leq 15\n$$\n\nThis inequality defines a band around the diagonal of the square.\n\n### Step 3: Find the area of the region where they see each other\nThe region where $|x - y| \\leq 15$ is the area between the lines $y = x + 15$ and $y = x - 15$. This forms a band around the diagonal of the square.\n\nThe area of the square outside this band (where they don't see each other) consists of two right triangles, each with base and height of $60 - 15 = 45$.
