Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Understand the cube's structure**: A cube has 6 faces and 8 vertices. Each vertex is formed by the intersection of 3 faces.\n2. **Face values**: Each face is assigned a different integer. Let these integers be $ a, b, c, d, e, f $.\n3. **Vertex values**: Each vertex is assigned the sum of the integers on the 3 faces that meet at that vertex.\n4. **Sum of all vertex values**: We are to compute the sum of all vertex values and determine the largest number that must divide this sum for any assignment of integers to the faces.\n\n### Step 1: Represent the cube's vertices\nEach vertex is the intersection of 3 faces. Depending on the cube's orientation, the faces can be grouped into pairs of opposite faces. For example, the cube can be considered to have:\n- Front and Back faces\n- Left and Right faces\n- Top and Bottom faces\n\nEach vertex is the intersection of one face from each of these three pairs.\n\n### Step 2: Determine how often each face value is used in the vertex sums\nEach face is part of 4 vertices. For example, the front face is part of 4 vertices (top-front-left, top-front-right, bottom-front-left, bottom-front-right). Therefore, each face value appears in exactly 4 vertex sums.\n\n### Step 3: Total sum of vertex values\nSince each face value is used in 4 vertex sums, and the total vertex sum is the sum of all vertex values, we can write the total sum as:\n$$\n\\text{Total Sum} = 4(a + b + c + d + e + f)\n$$\n\nThis means the total sum is always divisible by 4, regardless of the values assigned to the faces.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the largest number that must divide the total sum\nThe total sum is always a multiple of 4. However, the sum could also be a multiple of higher numbers (e.g., 8, 12, etc.) depending on the face values. But the problem asks for the **largest number that must divide the final sum for every possible numbering**.\n\nSince the total sum is always $ 4 \\times \\text{(sum of face values)} $, and the sum of face values can be any integer (since the face values are arbitrary integers), the only guaranteed divisor is **4**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$\n\n[OUTPUT] The largest number that must divide the final sum for every possible numbering of the faces is **4**.\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down into logical steps:\n\n1. **Cube Faces and Vertices**: A cube has 6 faces and 8 vertices. Each face is assigned a different integer.\n\n2. **Vertex Assignment**: Each vertex is the meeting point of 3 faces. So, the value assigned to a vertex is the sum of the integers on those 3 faces.\n\n3. **Summing All Vertex Values**: Since there are 8 vertices, we will calculate the sum of all vertex values.\n\n4. **Observation on Face Contributions**: Each face of the cube is adjacent to 4 vertices. Therefore, each face's integer value will be included in the sum of 4 vertices.\n\n5. **Total Sum of All Vertex Values**: If we denote the face values as $ a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 $, then the total sum of all vertex values is:\n   $$\n   4(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6)\n   $$\n   This is because each face contributes its value to 4 vertices.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The total sum of all vertex values is always divisible by 4, regardless of the specific integers assigned to the faces. Therefore, **4** is the largest number that must divide the final sum for every possible numbering of the faces.\n\n[OUTPUT] The largest number that must divide the final sum for every possible numbering of the faces is **4**.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Each face of a cube is assigned a different integer.
