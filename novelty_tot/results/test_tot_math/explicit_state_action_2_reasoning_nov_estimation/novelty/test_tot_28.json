This involves ensuring that the denominator is not zero and that the expression under the square root is non-negative.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the denominator\nThe denominator is $ \\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4} $. For this to be defined, the expression inside the square root must be strictly greater than 0 (since the square root of 0 would make the denominator zero, which is undefined). So, we solve the inequality:\n$$\nx^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Solve the inequality\nFactor the quadratic expression:\n$$\nx^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1)\n$$\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n$$\n(x - 4)(x + 1) > 0\n$$\n\nTo solve this inequality, find the critical points where the expression equals zero:\n$$\nx = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -1\n$$\n\nThese critical points divide the number line into three intervals:\n1. $ x < -1 $\n2. $ -1 < x < 4 $\n3. $ x > 4 $\n\nWe test the sign of the expression in each interval:\n- For $ x < -1 $, both $ x - 4 $ and $ x + 1 $ are negative, so the product is positive.\n- For $ -1 < x < 4 $, $ x - 4 $ is negative and $ x + 1 $ is positive, so the product is negative.\n- For $ x > 4 $, both $ x - 4 $ and $ x + 1 $ are positive, so the product is positive.\n\nThus, the inequality $ (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 $ is satisfied for:\n$$\nx \\in (-\\infty, -1) \\cup (4, \\infty)\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Final domain\nThe domain of the function is the set of all $ x $ for which the denominator is defined and non-zero, which is:\n$$\nx \\in (-\\infty, -1) \\cup (4, \\infty)\n$$\n\n[OUTPUT] The domain of the function $ f(x) = \\frac{x+6}{\\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}} $ is $ (-\\infty, -1) \\cup (4, \\infty) $.\nTo find the domain of the function $ f(x) = \\frac{x+6}{\\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}} $, we need to ensure the denominator is defined and not zero. The expression under the square root must be positive because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real number system, and the denominator cannot be zero.\n\n### Step 1: Set the expression under the square root greater than zero\n$$\nx^2 - 3x - 4 > 0\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression\n$$\nx^2 - 3x - 4 = (x - 4)(x + 1)\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Solve the inequality\n$$\n(x - 4)(x + 1) > 0\n$$\n\nThis inequality holds when both factors are positive or both are negative:\n- $ x > 4 $ (both factors are positive)\n- $ x < -1 $ (both factors are negative)\n\n### Step 4: Combine the intervals\n$$\nx \\in (-\\infty, -1) \\cup (4, \\infty)\n$$\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe domain of the function is $ (-\\infty, -1) \\cup (4, \\infty) $.\n\n[OUTPUT] The domain of the function $ f(x) = \\frac{x+6}{\\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}} $ is $ (-\\infty, -1) \\cup (4, \\infty) $.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x+6}{\\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?\nWhat is the state of the world after applying this action?
