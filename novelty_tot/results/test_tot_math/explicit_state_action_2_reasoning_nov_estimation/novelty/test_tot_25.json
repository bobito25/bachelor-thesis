Since $ P(x) $ is a cubic polynomial, and $ R(x) $ is also a cubic polynomial, the degree of $ P(Q(x)) $ must be $ \\deg(P(x)) + \\deg(R(x)) = 3 + 3 = 6 $.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the degree of $ P(Q(x)) $\nLet $ \\deg(Q(x)) = d $. Then $ \\deg(P(Q(x))) = \\deg(P(x)) \\cdot \\deg(Q(x)) = 3d $. So we have:\n\n$$\n3d = 6 \\Rightarrow d = 2\n$$\n\nThus, $ Q(x) $ must be a quadratic polynomial.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the roots of $ P(Q(x)) $\nSince $ P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) $, the roots of $ P(Q(x)) $ are the values of $ x $ for which $ Q(x) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $. So the equation $ Q(x) = 1 $, $ Q(x) = 2 $, and $ Q(x) = 3 $ must each have roots that are subsets of the roots of $ P(x) \\cdot R(x) $, which includes all the roots of $ P(x) $.\n\nIn other words, the roots of $ P(x) $ (i.e., $ x = 1, 2, 3 $) must be among the roots of $ Q(x) - 1 = 0 $, $ Q(x) - 2 = 0 $, and $ Q(x) - 3 = 0 $.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $\nSince $ Q(x) $ is a quadratic polynomial, and we want $ Q(x) - 1 $, $ Q(x) - 2 $, and $ Q(x) - 3 $ to have roots that include $ x = 1, 2, 3 $, we can think about assigning each of $ x = 1, 2, 3 $ to one of the three equations $ Q(x) = 1 $, $ Q(x) = 2 $, or $ Q(x) = 3 $.\n\nThis is equivalent to assigning the three roots $ x = 1, 2, 3 $ to the three values $ 1, 2, 3 $, which is a bijection. There are $ 3! = 6 $ such assignments.\n\nFor each such assignment, there is a unique quadratic polynomial $ Q(x) $ that satisfies the conditions (since a quadratic is uniquely determined by its values at three distinct points).\n\n### Step 5: Final answer\nThus, there are **6** such polynomials $ Q(x) $.\n\n[OUTPUT] The number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $ is $ \\boxed{6} $.\nWe are given the polynomial $ P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) $, and we are asked to find how many polynomials $ Q(x) $ exist such that there is a polynomial $ R(x) $ of degree 3 satisfying the equation:\n\n$$\nP(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of $ P(x) $\n\n$$\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)\n$$\n\nThis is a cubic polynomial with roots at $ x = 1, 2, 3 $. So, the equation $ P(x) = 0 $ has solutions $ x = 1, 2, 3 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the equation $ P(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x) $\n\nThis means that $ P(Q(x)) $ is divisible by $ P(x) $, and the quotient $ R(x) $ is a polynomial of degree 3. Since $ P(x) $ is a cubic polynomial, the degree of $ P(Q(x)) $ is:\n\n$$\n\\deg(P(Q(x))) = \\deg(P) \\cdot \\deg(Q) = 3 \\cdot \\deg(Q)\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, the degree of $ P(x) \\cdot R(x) $ is:\n\n$$\n\\deg(P(x)) + \\deg(R(x)) = 3 + 3 = 6\n$$\n\nSo we must have:\n\n$$\n3 \\cdot \\deg(Q) = 6 \\Rightarrow \\deg(Q) = 2\n$$\n\nThus, $ Q(x) $ must be a quadratic polynomial.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the roots of $ P(Q(x)) $\n\nWe know that $ P(Q(x)) = (Q(x) - 1)(Q(x) - 2)(Q(x) - 3) $, and we also know that $ P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) $.\n\nSo, for $ P(Q(x)) $ to be divisible by $ P(x) $, the polynomial $ P(Q(x)) $ must have the same roots as $ P(x) $, i.e., $ x = 1, 2, 3 $, possibly with higher multiplicities. That is, $ Q(x) $ must map the values $ x = 1, 2, 3 $ to one of the values $ 1, 2, 3 $ (since $ P(Q(x)) = 0 $ when $ Q(x) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $).\n\nSo, for each of the values $ x = 1, 2, 3 $, $ Q(x) $ must be in $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $. That is, $ Q(x) $ must map the set $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ to itself.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $\n\nWe are looking for all degree-2 polynomials $ Q(x) $ such that:\n\n$$\nQ(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}\n$$\n\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of functions from the set $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ to itself, such that the function is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nThere are $ 3^3 = 27 $ possible mappings from $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ to $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $, but not all of them can be represented as a degree-2 polynomial.\n\nHowever, we can use the fact that for any three distinct points $ x_1, x_2, x_3 $, there exists a unique polynomial $ Q(x) $ of degree at most 2 that passes through the points $ (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3) $. So, for each of the 27 mappings, there is a unique degree-2 polynomial $ Q(x) $ that satisfies $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\nBut not all of these 27 mappings will satisfy the original equation $ P(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x) $. We are only interested in those mappings where $ Q(x) $ is a degree-2 polynomial, and $ P(Q(x)) $ is divisible by $ P(x) $, which we have already established happens if and only if $ Q(x) $ maps $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ to $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\nSo, the number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $ is equal to the number of degree-2 polynomials that map $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ to $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $, and this is **6**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{6}\n$$\n\n[OUTPUT] The number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $ is $ \\boxed{6} $.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Let $P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$.

Since $ P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) $, this means $ P(Q(x)) $ must be divisible by $ (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) $.\n\n2. **Analyze the roots**: For $ P(Q(x)) $ to be divisible by $ P(x) $, it must vanish at the roots of $ P(x) $, i.e., at $ x = 1, 2, 3 $. Therefore, we require:\n   $$\n   P(Q(1)) = 0, \\quad P(Q(2)) = 0, \\quad P(Q(3)) = 0\n   $$\n   Since $ P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) $, the roots of $ P(x) $ are $ x = 1, 2, 3 $. So, $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $ must each be one of $ 1, 2, 3 $.\n\n3. **Count the possible values of $ Q(x) $**: Since $ Q(x) $ is a polynomial, and $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $ can independently be assigned to any of the values $ 1, 2, 3 $, there are $ 3^3 = 27 $ possible assignments for $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $.\n\n4. **Existence of such a polynomial $ Q(x) $**: For each such assignment, there exists a unique polynomial $ Q(x) $ of degree at most 2 that satisfies $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $ (by the interpolation theorem). However, the problem does not restrict the degree of $ Q(x) $, so even higher-degree polynomials could potentially satisfy the condition. However, we are only interested in the number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $, and the condition is fully determined by the values of $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $. Thus, the number of such polynomials is exactly the number of such assignments.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of polynomials $ Q(x) $ that satisfy the given condition is $ 3^3 = 27 $.\n\n[OUTPUT] The number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $ is $ 27 $.\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the given equation:\n\n$$\nP(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x)\n$$\n\nWhere $ P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) $ and $ R(x) $ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the form of $ P(x) $\n\nThe polynomial $ P(x) $ has degree 3 and has roots at $ x = 1, 2, 3 $. Therefore, $ P(x) $ is divisible by $ (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the equation $ P(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x) $\n\nSince $ P(Q(x)) $ is a composition of $ P $ and $ Q $, and $ P(x) $ has degree 3, the degree of $ P(Q(x)) $ is $ 3 \\cdot \\deg(Q(x)) $.\n\nOn the right-hand side, $ P(x) \\cdot R(x) $ has degree $ 3 + 3 = 6 $, because $ P(x) $ has degree 3 and $ R(x) $ has degree 3.\n\nThus, equating the degrees:\n\n$$\n3 \\cdot \\deg(Q(x)) = 6 \\Rightarrow \\deg(Q(x)) = 2\n$$\n\nSo $ Q(x) $ must be a polynomial of degree 2.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider the roots of $ P(Q(x)) $\n\nThe equation $ P(Q(x)) = 0 $ implies $ Q(x) = 1 $, $ Q(x) = 2 $, or $ Q(x) = 3 $. So the roots of $ P(Q(x)) $ are the roots of $ Q(x) - 1 = 0 $, $ Q(x) - 2 = 0 $, and $ Q(x) - 3 = 0 $.\n\nSince $ Q(x) $ is of degree 2, each of the equations $ Q(x) = a $ (for $ a = 1, 2, 3 $) can have at most 2 roots. So the total number of roots of $ P(Q(x)) $ is at most 6, which matches the degree of $ P(x) \\cdot R(x) $.\n\nNow, the polynomial $ P(x) \\cdot R(x) $ must have all the roots of $ P(Q(x)) $, and since $ P(x) $ already has the roots $ x = 1, 2, 3 $, the roots of $ R(x) $ must be the roots of $ Q(x) = 1, 2, 3 $, i.e., the roots of $ Q(x) - 1 = 0 $, $ Q(x) - 2 = 0 $, and $ Q(x) - 3 = 0 $.\n\nThus, for each of the values $ a = 1, 2, 3 $, the equation $ Q(x) = a $ must have exactly two roots (since $ Q(x) $ is of degree 2), and these are the roots of $ R(x) $.\n\nSo the total number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $ is determined by the number of degree-2 polynomials such that $ Q(x) = a $ has exactly two roots for each $ a = 1, 2, 3 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $\n\nLet\u2019s suppose $ Q(x) $ is a quadratic polynomial of the form:\n\n$$\nQ(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\n$$\n\nWe want $ Q(x) = 1 $, $ Q(x) = 2 $, and $ Q(x) = 3 $ to each have exactly two distinct roots. This is always true for a quadratic polynomial with distinct roots (i.e., discriminant $ > 0 $), and since we can shift and scale the polynomial to achieve this, we can find such polynomials.\n\nHowever, we are interested in how many such polynomials $ Q(x) $ of degree 2 satisfy the condition that $ P(Q(x)) $ is divisible by $ P(x) $. This is equivalent to saying that $ Q(x) $ maps the set $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ to itself, i.e., for each $ x \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $, $ Q(x) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\nSo we are looking for degree-2 polynomials $ Q(x) $ such that $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Count the number of such polynomials\n\nWe now count the number of degree-2 polynomials $ Q(x) $ such that $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\nEach of the values $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $ has 3 choices (1, 2, or 3), so there are:\n\n$$\n3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\n$$\n\npossible mappings from $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $ to $ \\{1, 2, 3\\} $.\n\nEach of these mappings corresponds to a unique polynomial $ Q(x) $ of degree at most 2. Since we are only interested in polynomials of degree exactly 2, we must ensure that the mapping is not constant or linear. But the problem allows for any polynomial $ Q(x) $ of degree 2 (not necessarily of degree exactly 2), so the total number of such polynomials is indeed 27.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n[OUTPUT] The number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $ is $ 27 $.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Let $P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$.
