In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, and they divide the rhombus into four right triangles.

In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means we can divide the rhombus into four right-angled triangles by drawing both diagonals.\n\nGiven:\n- Side length of the rhombus = 51 units\n- Length of the shorter diagonal = 48 units\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. The shorter diagonal divides the rhombus into two equal parts, so each half of the shorter diagonal is $ \\frac{48}{2} = 24 $ units.\n2. Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in one of the right-angled triangles formed by the diagonals and a side of the rhombus.\n   - One leg of the triangle = 24 units (half of the shorter diagonal)\n   - Hypotenuse = 51 units (side of the rhombus)\n   - Let the other leg be $ x $, which is half of the longer diagonal.\n\n3.
