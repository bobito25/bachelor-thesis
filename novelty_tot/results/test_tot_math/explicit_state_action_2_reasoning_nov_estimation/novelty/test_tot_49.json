The deck is shuffled randomly. We are to find the **expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers**.\n\n2. **Model the problem**: Consider the positions of the two jokers in the shuffled deck. Let\u2019s denote their positions as $ X $ and $ Y $, where $ X < Y $. The number of cards strictly between them is $ Y - X - 1 $.\n\n3. **Use symmetry and linearity of expectation**: Since the deck is shuffled randomly, the positions of the two jokers are uniformly and randomly distributed among the 54 positions. The key insight is that the expected number of cards between the two jokers can be derived by analyzing the average gap between two randomly chosen positions.\n\n4. **Compute the expected value**: For a shuffled deck of 54 cards, the expected number of cards between two randomly chosen positions is $ \\frac{54 - 2}{3} = 17.333... $. This is derived from the formula for expected number of cards between two randomly selected cards in a shuffled deck.\n\n[OUTPUT] Compute the expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers.\nTo compute the expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers in a shuffled deck of 54 cards (52 regular cards + 2 jokers), we proceed step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe have a shuffled deck of 54 cards, including 2 jokers. The positions of the two jokers are random. We are to compute the expected number of cards **strictly between** the two jokers.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Consider all possible positions for the two jokers\nLet the positions of the two jokers be $ i $ and $ j $, where $ 1 \\leq i < j \\leq 54 $ (since we are considering strictly between, we assume one joker comes before the other). The number of cards strictly between them is $ j - i - 1 $.\n\nWe are to compute the **expected value** of $ j - i - 1 $, over all possible pairs $ (i, j) $ with $ i < j $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Total number of possible pairs\nThere are $ \\binom{54}{2} = \\frac{54 \\cdot 53}{2} = 1431 $ possible pairs of positions for the two jokers.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Expected value of $ j - i - 1 $\nWe want:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[j - i - 1] = \\mathbb{E}[j - i] - 1\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s compute $ \\mathbb{E}[j - i] $, the expected difference between the positions of the two jokers.\n\nLet $ i $ and $ j $ be the positions of the two jokers, where $ i < j $. Then $ j - i $ can be from 1 to 53 (since $ j $ can be at most 54, and $ i $ at least 1).\n\nWe can compute $ \\mathbb{E}[j - i] $ by considering all possible pairs $ (i, j) $ and their contribution to the total.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute the expected value\nWe can use a symmetry argument. For any two positions among 54 cards, the expected distance between two randomly selected distinct positions is:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[j - i] = \\frac{53}{3} = 17.6667\n$$\n\nThis is a known result from probability and combinatorics for the expected difference between two randomly selected positions in a uniform random permutation.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[j - i - 1] = \\frac{53}{3} - 1 = \\frac{50}{3} \\approx 16.6667\n$$\n\n---\n\n### [OUTPUT]\nThe expected number of cards strictly between the two jokers is $ \\frac{50}{3} $, or approximately 16.67 cards.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.Two jokers are added to a $52$ card deck and the entire stack of $54$ cards is shuffled randomly.
