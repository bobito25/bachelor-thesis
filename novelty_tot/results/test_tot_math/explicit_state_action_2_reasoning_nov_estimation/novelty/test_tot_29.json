A $4 \\times 4$ grid of dots has 5 horizontal lines and 5 vertical lines (since each line separates rows or columns).\n2. To form a rectangle, we need to choose:\n   - 2 horizontal lines from the 5 available.\n   - 2 vertical lines from the 5 available.\n3. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 5 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.\n   - $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n4.

These lines form the sides of the rectangle.\n\nIn a $4 \\times 4$ grid of dots:\n- There are **5 horizontal lines** (since 4 rows of dots imply 5 horizontal grid lines).\n- There are **5 vertical lines** (since 4 columns of dots imply 5 vertical grid lines).\n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of Ways to Choose Horizontal Lines\nTo choose 2 horizontal lines from the 5 available, we use the combination formula:\n$$\n\\binom{5}{2} = 10\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Ways to Choose Vertical Lines\nSimilarly, to choose 2 vertical lines from the 5 available:\n$$\n\\binom{5}{2} = 10\n$$\n\n### Step 5: Multiply to Find Total Rectangles\nEach pair of horizontal lines and each pair of vertical lines forms a unique rectangle. Therefore, the total number of rectangles is:\n$$\n10 \\times 10 = 100\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n[OUTPUT] The total number of rectangles that can be formed by connecting four of the dots in a $4 \\times 4$ square array is **100**.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nSolve the math problem in small steps.How many different rectangles with sides parallel to the grid can be formed by connecting four of the dots in a $4\\times 4$ square array of dots, as in the figure below?\n[asy]size(2cm,2cm); for (int i=0; i<4; ++i) { for (int j=0; j<4; ++j) { filldraw(Circle((i, j), .05), black, black); } } [/asy] (Two rectangles are different if they do not share all four vertices.)\nWhat is the state of the world after applying this action?
