These chords intersect at point $ P $, and the distance between their midpoints is given as $ 12 $. The goal is to compute $ OP^2 $, express it as a reduced fraction $ \\frac{m}{n} $, and then find $ m + n \\mod 1000 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Use the Perpendicular Distance from the Center to the Chord\n\nFor a chord of length $ 2a $ in a circle of radius $ r $, the perpendicular distance $ d $ from the center to the chord satisfies:\n\n$$\nd^2 + a^2 = r^2\n$$\n\n- For chord $ AB $ (length $ 30 $, so $ a = 15 $):\n  $$\n  d^2 + 15^2 = 25^2 \\Rightarrow d^2 = 625 - 225 = 400 \\Rightarrow d = 20\n  $$\n- For chord $ CD $ (length $ 14 $, so $ a = 7 $):\n  $$\n  d^2 + 7^2 = 25^2 \\Rightarrow d^2 = 625 - 49 = 576 \\Rightarrow d = 24\n  $$\n\nThus, the midpoints $ M $ and $ N $ of chords $ AB $ and $ CD $ are at distances $ 20 $ and $ 24 $ from the center $ O $, respectively.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use Coordinates to Determine the Position of $ P $\n\nPlace the center $ O $ at the origin $ (0,0) $. Assume $ AB $ is horizontal with midpoint $ M $ at $ (0, -20) $, and $ CD $ is a chord with midpoint $ N $ at $ \\left( \\pm \\frac{16\\sqrt{14}}{5}, -\\frac{104}{5} \\right) $, since the distance between $ M $ and $ N $ is given as $ 12 $, and the coordinates satisfy this condition.\n\nUsing the equation of the line $ CD $ and solving for the intersection with line $ AB $ (which is horizontal at $ y = -20 $), we find the coordinates of point $ P $ as:\n\n$$\nP = \\left( \\pm \\frac{25\\sqrt{14}}{7}, -20 \\right)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute $ OP^2 $\n\nUsing the coordinates of $ P $, we compute:\n\n$$\nOP^2 = \\left( \\frac{25\\sqrt{14}}{7} \\right)^2 + (-20)^2 = \\frac{625 \\cdot 14}{49} + 400 = \\frac{8750}{49} + \\frac{19600}{49} = \\frac{28350}{49}\n$$\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n$$\n\\frac{28350}{49} = \\frac{4050}{7}\n$$\n\nHere, $ m = 4050 $ and $ n = 7 $, and since $ \\gcd(4050, 7) = 1 $, the fraction is in lowest terms.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute $ m + n \\mod 1000 $\n\n$$\nm + n = 4050 + 7 = 4057\n$$\n$$\n4057 \\mod 1000 = 57\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{57}\n$$"}
