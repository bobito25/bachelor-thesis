Then the edge length of the smaller tetrahedron is found to be $ \\frac{a}{3} $, based on the relative positions of the centroids (verified using coordinate geometry).\n\nThus, the **volume ratio** is:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Result:\n\nThe volume ratio is $ \\frac{1}{27} $, where $ m = 1 $ and $ n = 27 $, and they are relatively prime.\n\n$$\nm + n = 1 + 27 = \\boxed{28}\n$$"}
