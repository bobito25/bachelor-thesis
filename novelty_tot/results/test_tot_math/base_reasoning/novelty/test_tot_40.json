Since the ratio of the side lengths is 1/3, the ratio of the volumes is (1/3)^3 = 1/27. Therefore, the ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to that of the larger is 1/27, and m+n = 1+27 = 28.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nThe ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to that of the larger is 1/27, so m+n = 28.
