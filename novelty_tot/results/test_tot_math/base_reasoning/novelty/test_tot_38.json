We are given a circle with center $ O $ and radius $ 25 $, and two chords $ \\overline{AB} $ and $ \\overline{CD} $ intersecting at point $ P $. The lengths of the chords are $ AB = 30 $ and $ CD = 14 $, and the distance between the midpoints of the two chords is $ 12 $.\n\n**Step 1: Use the perpendicular bisector property of chords.**  \nIn a circle, the line from the center of the circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord and divides it into two equal parts. Let $ M $ and $ N $ be the midpoints of chords $ AB $ and $ CD $, respectively. Then $ OM \\perp AB $ and $ ON \\perp CD $, and $ OM $ and $ ON $ are the distances from the center to the chords.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find $ OM $ and $ ON $.**  \nFor chord $ AB $ of length $ 30 $, the half-length is $ 15 $.

Let $ M $ be at $ (x, 0) $, and $ N $ be at $ (x + 12, 0) $, since the distance between the midpoints is 12. The line $ OM $ is vertical (since it is perpendicular to chord $ AB $), and the line $ ON $ is also vertical (since it is perpendicular to chord $ CD $). However, the coordinates of the midpoints can be placed in such a way that the distance between them is 12.\n\n**Step 4: Use coordinate geometry to find $ P $.**  \nLet\u2019s place $ M $ at $ (a, 0) $ and $ N $ at $ (b, 0) $, where $ |a - b| = 12 $. The lines $ OM $ and $ ON $ are perpendicular to $ AB $ and $ CD $, respectively. Since $ AB $ is horizontal, $ OM $ is vertical, and $ CD $ is horizontal, $ ON $ is vertical.

The radius of the circle is 25, so the equation of the circle is:\n\n$$\nx^2 + y^2 = 25^2 = 625\n$$\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of the midpoints of the chords $ AB $ and $ CD $.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the midpoint of chord $ AB $ as $ M $ and the midpoint of chord $ CD $ as $ N $.\n\n### Step 1: Coordinates of Midpoints\n\nFor a chord of length $ l $ in a circle with radius $ r $, the distance $ d $ from the center of the circle to the chord is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nd = \\sqrt{r^2 - \\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)^2}\n$$\n\n#### For chord $ AB $ with length 30:\n\n$$\nd_{AB} = \\sqrt{25^2 - \\left(\\frac{30}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{625 - 225} = \\sqrt{400} = 20\n$$\n\nThus, the distance from the center $ O $ to the midpoint $ M $ of chord $ AB $ is 20 units.\n\n#### For chord $ CD $ with length 14:\n\n$$\nd_{CD} = \\sqrt{25^2 - \\left(\\frac{14}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{625 - 49} = \\sqrt{576} = 24\n$$\n\nThus, the distance from the center $ O $ to the midpoint $ N $ of chord $ CD $ is 24 units.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Distance Between Midpoints\n\nWe are told that the distance between the midpoints $ M $ and $ N $ is 12. Let\u2019s now place these midpoints in the coordinate plane such that this condition is satisfied.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the midpoint $ M $ lies along the x-axis for simplicity, so its coordinates are $ (20, 0) $ (since it is 20 units from the origin).\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the midpoint $ N $ lies in the plane such that the distance between $ M $ and $ N $ is 12. Let\u2019s denote the coordinates of $ N $ as $ (x, y) $, and use the distance formula:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{(x - 20)^2 + y^2} = 12\n$$\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n$$\n(x - 20)^2 + y^2 = 144\n$$\n\nWe also know that the distance from the origin to $ N $ is 24 (from earlier), so:\n\n$$\nx^2 + y^2 = 24^2 = 576\n$$\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1. $ (x - 20)^2 + y^2 = 144 $\n2. $ x^2 + y^2 = 576 $\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n$$\nx^2 + y^2 - [(x - 20)^2 + y^2] = 576 - 144\n$$\n\n$$\nx^2 - (x - 20)^2 = 432\n$$\n\nExpand $ (x - 20)^2 $:\n\n$$\nx^2 - (x^2 - 40x + 400) = 432\n$$\n\n$$\nx^2 - x^2 + 40x - 400 = 432\n$$\n\n$$\n40x = 832\n$$\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{832}{40} = 20.8\n$$\n\nNow substitute $ x = 20.8 $ into the second equation to find $ y $:\n\n$$\n(20.8)^2 + y^2 = 576\n$$\n\n$$\n432.64 + y^2 = 576\n$$\n\n$$\ny^2 = 576 - 432.64 = 143.36\n$$\n\n$$\ny = \\sqrt{143.36} \\approx 11.97\n$$\n\nSo the coordinates of $ N $ are approximately $ (20.8, 11.97) $.\n\n### Step 3: Coordinates of Point $ P $\n\nWe are given that the chords $ AB $ and $ CD $ intersect at point $ P $. Let\u2019s denote the coordinates of $ P $ as $ (x, y) $.\n\nFrom the properties of intersecting chords in a circle, we know that:\n\n$$\nPA \\cdot PB = PC \\cdot PD\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s denote the distances from $ P $ to the endpoints of the chords.
