To solve this, we need to break the problem into manageable steps based on the prime factorization of the LCMs.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization\nWe start by factoring the LCM values:\n- $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$\n- $2000 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3$\n\nEach of the numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ can be expressed in terms of their prime factors:\n- $a = 2^{x_1} \\cdot 5^{y_1}$\n- $b = 2^{x_2} \\cdot 5^{y_2}$\n- $c = 2^{x_3} \\cdot 5^{y_3}$\n\n### Step 2: LCM Conditions\nUsing the property that the LCM of two numbers takes the maximum exponent of each prime, we get the following constraints:\n1. $[a, b] = 2^{\\max(x_1, x_2)} \\cdot 5^{\\max(y_1, y_2)} = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$\n   - $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$\n   - $\\max(y_1, y_2) = 3$\n2. $[b, c] = 2^{\\max(x_2, x_3)} \\cdot 5^{\\max(y_2, y_3)} = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3$\n   - $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$\n   - $\\max(y_2, y_3) = 3$\n3. $[c, a] = 2^{\\max(x_3, x_1)} \\cdot 5^{\\max(y_3, y_1)} = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3$\n   - $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$\n   - $\\max(y_3, y_1) = 3$\n\n### Step 3: Determine Valid Ranges\nFrom the constraints above, we can determine valid ranges for the exponents:\n- For $x_1, x_2, x_3$:\n  - $\\max(x_1, x_2) = 3$: At least one of $x_1, x_2$ must be 3, and neither can exceed 3.\n  - $\\max(x_2, x_3) = 4$: At least one of $x_2, x_3$ must be 4, and neither can exceed 4.\n  - $\\max(x_3, x_1) = 4$: At least one of $x_3, x_1$ must be 4, and neither can exceed 4.\n\nFrom this, we deduce:\n- $x_1$ can be at most 4, and must be at least 3 if $x_3$ is not 4.\n- $x_2$ can be at most 4, and must be at least 3 if $x_1$ is not 4.\n- $x_3$ can be at most 4, and must be at least 3 if $x_2$ is not 4.\n\nSimilarly, for $y_1, y_2, y_3$:\n- $\\max(y_1, y_2) = 3$\n- $\\max(y_2, y_3) = 3$\n- $\\max(y_3, y_1) = 3$\n\nThis implies that all $y_i$ values must be at most 3, and at least one of $y_1, y_2$ must be 3, one of $y_2, y_3$ must be 3, and one of $y_3, y_1$ must be 3.\n\n### Next Step:\nCount the number of valid combinations of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ that satisfy the above constraints.\n\n[OUTPUT] Count the number of valid combinations of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ that satisfy the constraints.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nYou must output exactly the next step in solving the problem when prompted.
