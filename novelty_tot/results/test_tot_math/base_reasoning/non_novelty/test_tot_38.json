For chord $\\overline{AB}$ of length 30, the distance from the center to its midpoint is:\n$$\nd_{AB} = \\sqrt{25^2 - \\left(\\frac{30}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{625 - 225} = \\sqrt{400} = 20\n$$\nFor chord $\\overline{CD}$ of length 14, the distance from the center to its midpoint is:\n$$\nd_{CD} = \\sqrt{25^2 - \\left(\\frac{14}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{625 - 49} = \\sqrt{576} = 24\n$$\nNow, we place the midpoints of the chords in a coordinate system such that the center $ O $ is at the origin. Let the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ be at $ (0, 20) $ and the midpoint of $\\overline{CD}$ be at $ (x, y) $, such that the distance between $ (0, 20) $ and $ (x, y) $ is 12. This gives the equation:\n$$\n\\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 20)^2} = 12\n$$\nSquaring both sides:\n$$\nx^2 + (y - 20)^2 = 144\n$$\nWe also know that the distance from the center $ O $ to the midpoint of $\\overline{CD}$ is 24, so:\n$$\nx^2 + y^2 = 24^2 = 576\n$$\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n$$\nx^2 + (y - 20)^2 = 144\n$$\n$$\nx^2 + y^2 = 576\n$$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n$$\n(x^2 + y^2) - (x^2 + (y - 20)^2) = 576 - 144\n$$\n$$\ny^2 - (y^2 - 40y + 400) = 432\n$$\n$$\n40y - 400 = 432\n$$\n$$\n40y = 832\n$$\n$$\ny = \\frac{832}{40} = 20.8\n$$\nSubstituting $ y = 20.8 $ into $ x^2 + y^2 = 576 $:\n$$\nx^2 + (20.8)^2 = 576\n$$\n$$\nx^2 + 432.64 = 576\n$$\n$$\nx^2 = 143.36\n$$\n$$\nx = \\sqrt{143.36} \\approx 11.97\n$$\nSo, the midpoint of $\\overline{CD}$ is at approximately $ (11.97, 20.8) $.
