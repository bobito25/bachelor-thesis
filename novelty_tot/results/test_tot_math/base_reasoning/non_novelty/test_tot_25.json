The right-hand side is a product of $ P(x) $, which is degree 3, and $ R(x) $, which is also degree 3. Thus, the right-hand side has degree $ 3 + 3 = 6 $. Therefore, $ P(Q(x)) $ must also be a degree 6 polynomial.  \n\nSince $ P(x) $ is degree 3, $ Q(x) $ must be such that $ P(Q(x)) $ is degree 6. This implies $ Q(x) $ must be a degree 2 polynomial, because $ P(Q(x)) $ has degree $ 3 \\cdot \\deg(Q(x)) $. So:  \n$$\n3 \\cdot \\deg(Q(x)) = 6 \\Rightarrow \\deg(Q(x)) = 2\n$$  \n\n### Step 2: Consider the functional equation  \nWe are given $ P(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x) $. Since $ P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) $, we can write:  \n$$\nP(Q(x)) = (Q(x) - 1)(Q(x) - 2)(Q(x) - 3)\n$$  \nand  \n$$\nP(x) \\cdot R(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \\cdot R(x)\n$$  \nThus, we need:  \n$$\n(Q(x) - 1)(Q(x) - 2)(Q(x) - 3) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \\cdot R(x)\n$$  \n\nThis tells us that $ (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) $ must divide $ (Q(x) - 1)(Q(x) - 2)(Q(x) - 3) $. Therefore, $ Q(x) $ must be such that $ Q(x) - 1 $, $ Q(x) - 2 $, and $ Q(x) - 3 $ are divisible by $ (x-1) $, $ (x-2) $, and $ (x-3) $, respectively, in some permutation.  \n\n### Step 3: Consider the roots of $ P(Q(x)) $  \nSince $ P(Q(x)) = 0 $ when $ Q(x) = 1, 2, 3 $, the roots of $ P(Q(x)) $ are the roots of the equations $ Q(x) = 1, 2, 3 $. But the roots of $ P(x) \\cdot R(x) $ are the roots of $ P(x) $, i.e., $ x = 1, 2, 3 $, and the roots of $ R(x) $. Therefore, $ Q(x) $ must map $ x = 1, 2, 3 $ to values such that $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $, because otherwise $ P(Q(x)) $ would have roots not shared with $ P(x) \\cdot R(x) $.  \n\nThus, $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $. This gives us a finite number of possibilities to consider.  \n\n### Step 4: Count the number of such polynomials $ Q(x) $  \nSince $ Q(x) $ is a degree 2 polynomial, it is uniquely determined by its values at three distinct points. So, we can define $ Q(x) $ by choosing values $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $, and then interpolating a quadratic polynomial that passes through the points $ (1, Q(1)), (2, Q(2)), (3, Q(3)) $.  \n\nThere are $ 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27 $ total combinations of $ (Q(1), Q(2), Q(3)) $, but not all of them will yield a unique degree 2 polynomial. However, for each such triple, we can construct a unique polynomial of degree at most 2 that passes through those points. Some of these polynomials might be of lower degree (e.g., degree 1 or 0), but we are only interested in degree 2 polynomials.  \n\n### Step 5: Determine which of these polynomials are degree 2  \nWe need to exclude cases where the three points $ (1, Q(1)), (2, Q(2)), (3, Q(3)) $ lie on a line (i.e., the interpolating polynomial is degree 1 or 0). This occurs when the three points are collinear.  \n\nThus, the next step is to count how many of the 27 combinations of $ Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) $ result in a degree 2 polynomial.  \n\n[OUTPUT] Count the number of triples $ (Q(1), Q(2), Q(3)) \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}^3 $ such that the interpolating polynomial is of degree 2.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nYou must output exactly the next step in solving the problem when prompted.
