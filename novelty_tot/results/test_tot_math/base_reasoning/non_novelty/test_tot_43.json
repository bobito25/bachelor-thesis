On Saturday, he begins at $z$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^3,z^5,z^7,\\ldots,z^{2013}$ in that order; on Sunday, he begins at $1$ and delivers milk to houses located at $z^2,z^4,z^6,\\ldots,z^{2012}$ in that order.  Eli always walks directly (in a straight line) between two houses. If the distance he must travel from his starting point to the last house is $\\sqrt{2012}$ on both days, find the real part of $z^2$.\nThis is the plan so far:\nSubstitute $ z^{2013} = z \\cdot z^{2012} $ into $ |z^{2013} - z| $ and use $ |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012} $ to simplify the expression.\nSolve for $ |z| $ using $ |z| \\cdot \\sqrt{2012} = \\sqrt{2012} $.\nDetermine the value of $ \\theta $ using the given distance information and compute $ \\cos(2\\theta) $.\nDetermine $ \\theta $ using the equation $ |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012} $ and compute $ \\cos(2\\theta) $.\nDetermine $ \\theta $ using the equation $ |z^{2012} - 1| = \\sqrt{2012} $ and compute $ \\cos(2\\theta) $.\nNow you must find the next step.
