Output [FINISHED] when you are finished with solving the problem.\nThis is your problem statement:\nI am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do\n\nPick up a block\nUnstack a block from on top of another block\nPut down a block\nStack a block on top of another block\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nI can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.\nI can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\nFor example, if I have a blue block on the table and a red block on top of it (and clear), then I may NOT pick up the red block because it is on top of another block. This means I must instead unstack it.\nGiven the start state the yellow block is on the table, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is clear, the blue block is on top of the red block, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the goal atoms the red block is on top of the orange block, generate a plan to reach the goal state. [PLAN]\nThis is the plan so far:\nUnstack the orange block from the blue block.\nPut down the orange block on the table.\nUnstack the red block from the yellow block.\nStack the red block on top of the orange block.\nUnstack the blue block from the red block.\nNow you must find the next step.
