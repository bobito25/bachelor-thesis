To place blue on red, red must be clear. However, yellow is on red, so we must first unstack yellow from red. But yellow is not clear because orange is on top of it. Thus, we need to unstack orange from yellow first. \n\n[OUTPUT] Unstack orange from yellow.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nYou must output exactly the next step in solving the problem when prompted.
