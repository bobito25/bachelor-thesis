Here are the actions I can do\n\nPick up a block\nUnstack a block from on top of another block\nPut down a block\nStack a block on top of another block\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nI can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.\nI can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\nFor example, if I have a blue block on the table and a red block on top of it (and clear), then I may NOT pick up the red block because it is on top of another block. This means I must instead unstack it.\nGiven the start state the red block is clear, the blue block is on the table, the yellow block is clear, the red block is on the table, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block and the goal atoms the red block is on top of the yellow block and the orange block is on top of the red block, generate a plan to reach the goal state. [PLAN]\nThis is the plan so far:\nPick up the yellow block.\nStack the yellow block on top of the red block.\nPut down the yellow block.\nPick up the orange block.\nStack the orange block on top of the yellow block.\nPick up the red block.\nStack the red block on top of the orange block.\nNow you must find the next step.
