Let's re-evaluate the goal and the steps required. The goal is to have the blue block on top of the red block. However, the red block is currently on top of the blue block. To achieve the goal, we need to unstack the red block from the blue block and then stack it on top of the blue block. However, this is already attempted in the initial steps. The next step should be to unstack the yellow block from the red block to make it clear so we can manipulate the red block further. \n\n[OUTPUT] Unstack the yellow block from the red block.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nYou must output exactly the next step in solving the problem when prompted.
