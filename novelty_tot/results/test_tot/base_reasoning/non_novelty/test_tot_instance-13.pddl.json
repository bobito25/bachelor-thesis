The correct approach would be to first unstack the orange block from the blue block (as it is currently on top of it), then stack it on the red block. The red block must be clear for this to happen, and the blue block must be clear for the red block to be stacked on top of it. The next logical step is to unstack the orange block from the blue block.  \n[OUTPUT] Unstack the orange block from the blue block.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nYou must output exactly the next step in solving the problem when prompted.
