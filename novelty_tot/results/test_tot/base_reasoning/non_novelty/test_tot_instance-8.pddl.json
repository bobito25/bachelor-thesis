A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\nFor example, if I have a blue block on the table and a red block on top of it (and clear), then I may NOT pick up the red block because it is on top of another block. This means I must instead unstack it.\nGiven the start state the blue block is on the table, the yellow block is clear, the red block is on the table, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the goal atoms the blue block is on top of the red block and the orange block is on top of the yellow block, generate a plan to reach the goal state. [PLAN]\nThis is the plan so far:\nUnstack the yellow block from the red block.\nUnstack the orange block from the blue block.\nPut down the yellow block on the table.\nStack the orange block on top of the yellow block.\nStack the blue block on top of the red block.\nNow you must find the next step.
