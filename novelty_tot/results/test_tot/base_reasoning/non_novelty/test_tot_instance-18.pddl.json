The step \"Pick up the blue block\" is unnecessary because the blue block is already on the table and clear. The next step should be to stack the blue block on top of the yellow block, which is already in the plan. However, the plan seems to have completed the necessary steps to achieve the goal state. \n\n[OUTPUT]\n[FINISHED]", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nYou must output exactly the next step in solving the problem when prompted.
