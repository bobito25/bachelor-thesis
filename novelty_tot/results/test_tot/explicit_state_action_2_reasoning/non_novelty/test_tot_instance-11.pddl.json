For a block to be unstacked, it must be clear (no blocks on top of it). The red block is currently on top of the orange block, and the yellow block is not in hand, so the red block is not clear. To proceed, we need to make the red block clear. This can be done by unstacking the yellow block from the red block. However, the yellow block is not on top of the red block, so we need to first move the yellow block to the table or another clear block.

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\nFor example, if I have a blue block on the table and a red block on top of it (and clear), then I may NOT pick up the red block because it is on top of another block. This means I must instead unstack it.\n"}
