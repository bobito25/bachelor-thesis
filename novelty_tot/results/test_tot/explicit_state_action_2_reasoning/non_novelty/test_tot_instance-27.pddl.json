Specifically, the blue block must be on top of the yellow block and clear for the unstacking to occur. However, the problem statement does not provide enough information to confirm that the blue block is on top of the yellow block or that it is clear.\n\n[OUTPUT] The state of the world remains unchanged because the action \"Unstack the blue block from the yellow block\" could not be performed due to insufficient information or unmet preconditions.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nI am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks.

This is likely because the blue block is not on top of the yellow block. Based on the initial state, the blue block was on top of the red block, and the yellow block was on top of the orange block. Therefore, the blue block is not on top of the yellow block, making the unstacking action invalid.\n\nTo reach the goal state, we need to ensure the following:\n- The blue block is on top of the red block.\n- The orange block is on top of the yellow block.\n- The yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n\nThe blue block is already on top of the red block. However, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, and the blue block is not on top of the yellow block.

Then, we can pick up the yellow block.\n5. Next, we can stack the yellow block on top of the blue block, but the blue block is not clear (it has the red block on top of it).\n6. Therefore, we must first unstack the red block from the blue block:\n   - The red block is clear and on top of the blue block, so we can unstack it.\n   - After unstacking, the blue block becomes clear.\n7.
