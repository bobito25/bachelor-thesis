A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\nFor example, if I have a blue block on the table and a red block on top of it (and clear), then I may NOT pick up the red block because it is on top of another block. This means I must instead unstack it.\n"}
