However, based on the previous actions, the red block was stacked on top of the blue block, and no other block has been placed on top of it. The error likely arises from attempting to unstack the red block before it is clear.\n\nTo resolve this, we must first ensure that the red block is clear. Since the red block is on top of the blue block and no other block is on top of it, it should be clear. However, if the blue block is not clear, we must ensure that the blue block is clear before unstacking the red block.
