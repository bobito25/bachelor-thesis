In the current state:\n- The yellow block is on top of the orange block (this matches the goal).\n- The orange block is not clear (this is not a problem for the goal).\n- The blue block is not clear (this is the issue, as it needs to be clear to stack the orange block on top of it).\n- The red block is on the table and clear (not needed for the goal, but can be used if necessary).\n\nTo reach the goal, we need to stack the orange block on top of the blue block. However, the blue block is not clear (there might be another block on top of it). We need to clear the blue block first. Since the red block is on the table and clear, we can temporarily move it to a different location if needed, but it's not necessary. Instead, we can directly unstack any block that might be on top of the blue block (if any). However, based on the current state, it seems that the blue block is not clear because the orange block is on top of it. This is not possible since the orange block is on top of the yellow block, not the blue block. Therefore, the blue block must be clear.\n\nSince the blue block is not clear, we need to investigate why. It may be that there is a block on top of the blue block, but this is not mentioned in the current state.

This action is allowed.\n\n4. **After unstacking the yellow block, can we pick up the orange block?**  \n   - Yes, because the orange block is now clear.\n\n5. **After picking up the orange block, can we stack it on top of the blue block?**  \n   - The blue block is not clear (some block is on top of it). So we must first unstack the block on top of the blue block before proceeding.\n\n6. **Is the blue block clear?**  \n   - It is not clear. Therefore, we must unstack the block on top of it.\n\n7. **Assuming the blue block is on the table with another block on top of it, we unstack the top block from the blue block.**  \n   - Once the blue block is clear, we can stack the orange block on top of it.\n\nAfter all these steps, the final state of the world will be:\n\n- The yellow block is on the table and clear.\n- The orange block is on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block is no longer clear (since the orange block is on top of it).\n- The hand is empty.\n\n[OUTPUT] The yellow block is on the table and clear.
