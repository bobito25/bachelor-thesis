This will make the yellow block clear, allowing us to pick it up and stack it on the blue block.\n\nAfter unstacking the red block and stacking the yellow block on the blue block, the new state of the world would be:\n\n- The red block is on the table and clear.\n- The yellow block is on top of the blue block and not clear.\n- The blue block is on the table and not clear.\n- The orange block is on the table and clear.\n- The hand is empty.\n\n[OUTPUT] The red block is on the table and clear.
