The hand must be empty. \u2705 (The hand is empty.)\n2. The orange block must be on top of the red block. \u2705 (The orange block is on top of the red block.)\n3. The orange block must be clear. \u2705 (The orange block is clear because it is on top of the red block and no other blocks are on it.)\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, the orange block can be unstacked from the red block. After this action:\n- The orange block is picked up (hand is now holding it).\n- The red block is now clear (since the orange block was on top of it and is now removed).\n\n[OUTPUT] The orange block is being held by the hand, the red block is now clear, and the blue block is on top of the yellow block and is clear.
