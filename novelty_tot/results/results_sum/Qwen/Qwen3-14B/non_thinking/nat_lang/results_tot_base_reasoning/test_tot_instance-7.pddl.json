For example, unstacking the red block from the blue block twice and trying to unstack the blue block from the table when it is already on the table is unnecessary and potentially invalid. We need to focus on directly achieving the goal state.\n\nThe goal is for the blue block to be on top of the red block, and the red block to be on top of the yellow block.
