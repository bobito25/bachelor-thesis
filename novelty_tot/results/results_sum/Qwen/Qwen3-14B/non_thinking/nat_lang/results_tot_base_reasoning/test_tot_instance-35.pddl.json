This is valid.  \nStep 2: Once we unstack the red block, we can stack it on top of the yellow block, which is clear and on the table. This brings the red block closer to the goal state (orange block is on top of yellow block).  \nStep 3: Now we need to move the blue block (which is on top of the yellow block). We can unstack the blue block from the yellow block since it is on top and clear.  \nStep 4: After unstacking the blue block, we can stack it on top of the red block, achieving the second part of the goal state (blue block on top of red block).  \nStep 5: The orange block is clear and on the table. We can pick it up and stack it on top of the yellow block to complete the first part of the goal state (orange block on top of yellow block).  \n\nThe corrected and simplified plan is:\n1.
