Let's analyze them one by one:\n\n1. **Pick up a block:**\n   - You can only pick up a block that is on the table and clear.\n   - Given the state: {(on b c), (on d a), (ontable a), (on c d), (handempty), (clear b)}\n   - The only block currently on the table is block 'a', but it is not clear because block 'd' is on it.\n   - Therefore, there are no clear blocks on the table that can be picked up.\n\n2. **Unstack a block:**\n   - You can unstack a block only if it is on top of another block, and it is clear, and your hand is empty.\n   - Block 'b' is on block 'c' and is clear, thus you can unstack 'b' from 'c'.\n   - Block 'd' is on block 'a', and block 'c' is on block 'd', but the action to perform this unstacking is not allowed because they are not the top clear block.\n   - Therefore, the possible unstack action is:\n     - Unstack 'b' from 'c'\n\n3. **Put down a block:**\n   - This action can only occur if you are already holding a block. But currently, (handempty) means no block is being held. Thus, no put-down actions are possible in this state.\n\n4. **Stack a block on top of another block:**\n   - This action can only occur if you are holding a block and want to place it on another clear block. Again, since no block is currently being held, no stacking actions are possible in this state.\n\nBased on this analysis, the possible actions are:\n\n- Unstack(b, c)\n\nThis is the only action available given the current state and restrictions.",
