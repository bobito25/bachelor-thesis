Try subtracting a larger number from a smaller one to get a negative result:\n   - 3 - 9 = -6\n   - 6 - 7 = -1\n\nNow we see that 6 - 7 = -1 is a direct way to reach the target. We still need to use the remaining numbers (3 and 9), but since they are not needed for the final result, we can combine them in a way that doesn't affect the target (e.g., 3 - 9 = -6, but we can ignore it as long as we use all numbers).\n\nHowever, we must use all numbers in the process. So let's try combining 3 and 9 first:\n   - 3 + 9 = 12\n\nNow we have 12, 6, and 7. Next, we can do:\n   - 12 - 7 = 5\n\nNow we have 5 and 6. Finally:\n   - 6 - 5 = 1\n\nThis doesn't give us -1.
