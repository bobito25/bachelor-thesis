To fully solve the problem, we need to incorporate the remaining numbers (2 and 6) in a way that does not affect the target result. One way to do this is to combine 2 and 6 using an operation that results in 0 (e.g., 6 - 2 = 4, but then we would need to subtract 4 again, which is not ideal). Alternatively, we can combine them in a way that cancels out their contribution, such as (6 - 6) or (2 - 2), but we only have one of each number.\n\nInstead, we can use the following approach:\n- First, calculate (1 - 4) = -3.\n- Then, combine 2 and 6 in a way that does not change the result, such as multiplying by 1 (e.g., (6 / 6) = 1 or (2 / 2) = 1). However, division is not an allowed operation.\n\nSince we cannot use division, we need to find a way to use 2 and 6 with +, -, or * such that the result is 0. One possible way is:\n- (6 - 2) = 4, and then (4 - 4) = 0. But we do not have another 4.\n\nAnother option is to use the following sequence:\n1. (1 - 4) = -3\n2. (6 - 2) = 4\n3. Then, combine -3 and 4 in a way that cancels out 4, but this would require using -4, which is not directly available.\n\nThus, the best approach is to combine 2 and 6 in a way that results in 0.

Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach to ensure that all numbers are used and the target is reached.\n\n[OUTPUT] (1 - 4) = -3 and (6 - 2) = 4, then combine -3 and 4 to get -3.\nReasoning: The operations (1 - 4) = -3 and (6 - 2) = 4 use all the numbers (1, 2, 4, 6). Then combining -3 and 4 using subtraction gives -3 - 4 = -7, which is not the target number. However, if we combine -3 and 4 using addition, we get -3 + 4 = 1, which is also not the target number.
