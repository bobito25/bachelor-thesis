We are aiming for a negative number (-10), so subtraction or a combination of operations that result in a negative value is essential.\n2. Let's consider combining 9 and 5 first:  \n   - 9 - 5 = 4  \n   - 5 - 9 = -4  \n   - 9 * 5 = 45  \n   - 5 + 9 = 14  \n\n   The result **-4** is promising because it is negative and relatively small in magnitude.\n\n3. Now we have -4, and the remaining numbers are 1 and 3.  \n   - -4 - 3 = -7  \n   - -4 - 1 = -5  \n   - -4 + 3 = -1  \n   - -4 + 1 = -3  \n   - -4 * 3 = -12  \n   - -4 * 1 = -4  \n\n   The result **-12** is very close to the target of -10. If we can add 2, we'd reach -10.\n\n4. We haven\u2019t used the number **1** and **3** yet. Let's try:  \n   - 3 - 1 = 2  \n\n   So, if we do:  \n   - (9 - 5) = -4  \n   - (3 - 1) = 2  \n   - -4 + 2 = -2 (not enough)  \n   - -4 * 2 = -8 (not enough)  \n   - -4 * 3 = -12  \n   - -12 + 1 = -11  \n   - -12 + 3 = -9  \n\n   The closest we can get is **-12**. To reach -10, we need to add **2**.\n\n5. Try combining 1 and 3 to get **2**, then add it to -12:  \n   - (9 - 5) = -4  \n   - (3 - 1) = 2  \n   - -4 * 3 = -12  \n   - -12 + 2 = -10 \u2705\n\n### Final sequence:\n1. 9 - 5 = -4  \n2. 3 - 1 = 2  \n3. -4 * 3 = -12  \n4. -12 + 2 = -10  \n\n[OUTPUT] (9 - 5) * 3 + (3 - 1)\nLet's evaluate the expression step by step:\n\n1. Calculate (9 - 5):  \n   $ 9 - 5 = 4 $\n\n2. Multiply the result by 3:  \n   $ 4 * 3 = 12 $\n\n3. Calculate (3 - 1):  \n   $ 3 - 1 = 2 $\n\n4. Add the results from step 2 and step 3:  \n   $ 12 + 2 = 14 $\n\nThe final result is **14**, not the target number **-10**.

We can combine two numbers at a time using +, -, or * and must use all numbers exactly once.\n\n### Given:\n- After combining **5 and 9 using subtraction**, the result is **-4**.\n- The state of the world now is: **Numbers available are -8, 8, -4**.\n\nThis implies that **5 and 9 have already been used** (as they were combined), and the result **-4** is now part of the available numbers.\n\nSo the original numbers must have included **5, 9, -8, 8**, and possibly another number (which is now missing from the state). However, the state only includes **-8, 8, -4**, so the other number (probably 5 or 9) might have been consumed in the subtraction already.\n\n### Re-evaluation:\nLet\u2019s consider the full set of numbers again, assuming the original numbers were **5, 9, -8, 8**.\n\n- Step 1: **9 - 5 = 4** (not -4).  \n- Step 2: If **5 - 9 = -4**, that matches the given state. So the operation **5 - 9 = -4** is correct.\n- Numbers used: **5, 9**\n- Numbers available: **-8, 8, -4**\n\nNow, the next step would be to combine the remaining numbers **-8, 8, -4** using +, -, or *.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possible combinations:\n\n- **8 + (-8) = 0**\n- **0 + (-4) = -4**\n\nThis would result in **-4** as the final result. However, this is not necessarily the target unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, if the target was **0**, this would be a valid path.\n\n### Final State of the World:\n- Numbers used: **5, 9, -8, 8**\n- Result from combining: **-4**\n- Final result: **-4**\n\n[OUTPUT] The state of the world after combining 5 and 9 using subtraction is: Numbers available are -8, 8, -4.
