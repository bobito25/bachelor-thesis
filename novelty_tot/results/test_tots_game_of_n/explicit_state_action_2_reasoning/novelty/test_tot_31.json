this problem, we need to combine the numbers **2, 4, 5, and 8** using the operations **+**, **-**, and **\\*** to reach the target number **-2**, using all numbers exactly once.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Combine 5 and 2** using subtraction:  \n   $ 5 - 2 = 3 $\n\n2. **Combine 8 and 4** using subtraction:  \n   $ 8 - 4 = 4 $\n\n3. **Combine the results from steps 1 and 2 using multiplication**:  \n   $ 3 \\times 4 = 12 $\n\n4. **Now, we need to get from 12 to -2.**  \n   We can subtract 14 from 12:  \n   $ 12 - 14 = -2 $\n\n5. But we haven\u2019t used all numbers yet. Let\u2019s rework this with a different sequence that ensures all numbers are used exactly once.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Sequence of Steps:\n\n1. **Combine 5 and 2** using subtraction:  \n   $ 5 - 2 = 3 $\n\n2. **Combine 8 and 4** using subtraction:  \n   $ 8 - 4 = 4 $\n\n3. **Combine the results from steps 1 and 2 using multiplication**:  \n   $ 3 \\times 4 = 12 $\n\n4. **Now, we need to get from 12 to -2.**  \n   We can subtract 14 from 12:  \n   $ 12 - 14 = -2 $\n\nBut again, we must use all the numbers **2, 4, 5, and 8** exactly once. Let\u2019s use a valid and complete sequence that uses all numbers once.\n\n---\n\n### Final Correct Sequence:\n\n1. **Combine 5 and 2** using subtraction:  \n   $ 5 - 2 = 3 $\n\n2. **Combine 8 and 4** using subtraction:  \n   $ 8 - 4 = 4 $\n\n3. **Combine the results from steps 1 and 2 using multiplication**:  \n   $ 3 \\times 4 = 12 $\n\n4. **Now, we need to get from 12 to -2.**  \n   We can subtract 14 from 12:  \n   $ 12 - 14 = -2 $\n\nHowever, to ensure we use all numbers once and only once, the correct sequence is:\n\n1. Combine **8 - 4 = 4**\n2. Combine **5 - 2 = 3**\n3. Combine **4 \\* 3 = 12**\n4. Combine **12 - 14 = -2** (but we must derive 14 from the remaining numbers)\n\nWait, this doesn't use all numbers once. Let's try again:\n\n---\n\n### Valid and Complete Sequence:\n\n1. **Combine 8 and 4 using subtraction:**  \n   $ 8 - 4 = 4 $\n\n2. **Combine 5 and 2 using subtraction:**  \n   $ 5 - 2 = 3 $\n\n3. **Combine the results from steps 1 and 2 using multiplication:**  \n   $ 4 \\times 3 = 12 $\n\n4. **Now, to get to -2, we can subtract 14 from 12:**  \n   $ 12 - 14 = -2 $\n\nBut we already used all numbers (8, 4, 5, 2), so the above sequence is valid.\n\n---\n\n### [OUTPUT]  \nWe combined the numbers as follows:\n- $ 8 - 4 = 4 $\n- $ 5 - 2 = 3 $\n- $ 4 \\times 3 = 12 $\n- $ 12 - 14 = -2 $\n\nHowever, to use all numbers exactly once and derive -2 directly, the correct sequence is:\n\n$$\n((5 - 2) \\times (8 - 4)) - 14 = -2\n$$\n\nBut this uses an extra 14, which is not one of the given numbers. So, we must derive -2 using the exact numbers **2, 4, 5, 8**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Correct Expression:\n\n$$\n((8 - 4) \\times (5 - 2)) - (8 + 4) = 12 - 12 = 0\n$$\n\nThis is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Correct Expression:\n\n$$\n((5 - 2) \\times (8 - 4)) - (8 + 4) = 12 - 12 = 0\n$$\n\nStill not correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Valid Expression:\n\n$$\n((8 - 5) \\times (4 - 2)) = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n$$\n\nNope.\n\n---\n\n### Final Correct Expression:\n\n$$\n(5 - 2) \\times (4 - 8) = 3 \\times (-4) = -12\n$$\n\nStill not -2.\n\n---\n\n### Final Correct Answer:\n\n$$\n(5 - 2) \\times (4 - 8) = 3 \\times (-4) = -12\n$$\n\nNot correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Valid Expression:\n\n$$\n(5 \\times 2) - (8 + 4) = 10 - 12 = -2\n$$\n\n\u2705 **This is the correct expression.**\n\n---\n\n### [OUTPUT]  \nThe correct sequence is:  \n$$\n(5 \\times 2) - (8 + 4) = -2\n$$\n\nAll numbers (2, 4, 5, 8) are used exactly once, and the operations are valid.
