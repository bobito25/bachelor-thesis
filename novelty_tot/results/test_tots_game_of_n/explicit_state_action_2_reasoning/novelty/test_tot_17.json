Since we have 8 as the largest number, we can try subtracting it from a sum or product of the other numbers.\n\nLet's try the following steps:\n\n1. Combine 1 and 2 using addition:  \n   $1 + 2 = 3$\n\n2. Combine 3 (from step 1) and 5 using multiplication:  \n   $3 * 5 = 15$\n\n3.

Combine 2 and 1 using addition:  \n   $2 + 1 = 3$\n\n3. Subtract 3 from 40:  \n   $40 - 3 = 37$  \n   Not helpful.\n\nTry this:\n\n1. Combine 8 and 2 using subtraction:  \n   $8 - 2 = 6$\n\n2.

Combine the results from steps 1 and 2 using subtraction:  \n   $ 3 - 1 = 2 $\n\nThis doesn't give us -1. Let's try a different order.\n\n1. Combine 5 and 2 using addition:  \n   $ 5 + 2 = 7 $\n\n2. Combine 8 and 1 using subtraction:  \n   $ 8 - 1 = 7 $\n\n3. Combine the results from steps 1 and 2 using subtraction:  \n   $ 7 - 7 = 0 $\n\nStill not -1. Let's try:\n\n1. Combine 8 and 5 using subtraction:  \n   $ 8 - 5 = 3 $\n\n2. Combine 3 and 2 using subtraction:  \n   $ 3 - 2 = 1 $\n\n3. Combine 1 and 1 using subtraction:  \n   $ 1 - 1 = 0 $\n\nStill not -1. Let's try a different path:\n\n1. Combine 5 and 2 using subtraction:  \n   $ 5 - 2 = 3 $\n\n2. Combine 8 and 1 using subtraction:  \n   $ 8 - 1 = 7 $\n\n3. Combine 3 and 7 using subtraction:  \n   $ 3 - 7 = -4 $\n\nStill not -1. Let's try:\n\n1. Combine 8 and 2 using subtraction:  \n   $ 8 - 2 = 6 $\n\n2. Combine 5 and 1 using subtraction:  \n   $ 5 - 1 = 4 $\n\n3. Combine 6 and 4 using subtraction:  \n   $ 6 - 4 = 2 $\n\nStill not -1. Let's try:\n\n1. Combine 8 and 5 using addition:  \n   $ 8 + 5 = 13 $\n\n2. Combine 2 and 1 using addition:  \n   $ 2 + 1 = 3 $\n\n3. Combine 13 and 3 using subtraction:  \n   $ 13 - 3 = 10 $\n\nStill not -1. Let's try:\n\n1. Combine 8 and 5 using multiplication:  \n   $ 8 \\times 5 = 40 $\n\n2. Combine 2 and 1 using addition:  \n   $ 2 + 1 = 3 $\n\n3. Combine 40 and 3 using subtraction:  \n   $ 40 - 3 = 37 $\n\nStill not -1. Let's try:\n\n1. Combine 8 and 5 using subtraction:  \n   $ 8 - 5 = 3 $\n\n2. Combine 2 and 1 using multiplication:  \n   $ 2 \\times 1 = 2 $\n\n3. Combine 3 and 2 using subtraction:  \n   $ 3 - 2 = 1 $\n\nStill not -1. Let's try:\n\n1. Combine 8 and 1 using subtraction:  \n   $ 8 - 1 = 7 $\n\n2. Combine 5 and 2 using subtraction:  \n   $ 5 - 2 = 3 $\n\n3. Combine 7 and 3 using subtraction:  \n   $ 7 - 3 = 4 $\n\nStill not -1. Let's try:\n\n1. Combine 5 and 2 using multiplication:  \n   $ 5 \\times 2 = 10 $\n\n2. Combine 8 and 1 using subtraction:  \n   $ 8 - 1 = 7 $\n\n3.
