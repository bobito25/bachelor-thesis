However, the problem states that all numbers must be used exactly once.\n\nTherefore, we need a valid expression using all numbers (1, 2, 4, 7) to get to 5. One such expression is:\n\n(7 - 4) + (2 - 1) = 3 + 1 = 4 (not 5)\n\nAnother valid expression:\n\n(4 - 1) + (7 - 2) = 3 + 5 = 8 (not 5)\n\nAnother attempt:\n\n(7 - 4) * (2 - 1) = 3 * 1 = 3 (not 5)\n\nAnother attempt:\n\n(7 - 2) - (4 - 1) = 5 - 3 = 2 (not 5)\n\nAnother attempt:\n\n(7 - 4) + (2 + 1) = 3 + 3 = 6 (not 5)\n\nAnother attempt:\n\n(7 - 2) - (4 - 1) = 5 - 3 = 2 (not 5)\n\nAnother attempt:\n\n(4 - 1) + (7 - 2) = 3 + 5 = 8 (not 5)\n\nAnother attempt:\n\n(7 - 4) * 2 - 1 = 3 * 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\n\nThis uses all numbers (7, 4, 2, 1) and results in the target number 5.\n\n[OUTPUT] The state of the world after applying the action is: (7 - 4) * 2 - 1 = 5.
