One possible approach is to try combinations that get close to 15. For example, 9 + 3 + 1 = 13, and then adding 8 would overshoot. Alternatively, 8 + 9 = 17, which is close to 15. If we subtract 1 and 3 from that, we get 17 - 1 - 3 = 13. Another option is to multiply 3 and 1 to get 3, and then add 8 and 9 to get 17, which is still too high. A better path might be to try 9 + 3 + 1 + 8 = 21, which is too high. We need to find a way to reduce this to 15. A possible path is 9 + 3 + (8 - 1) = 19, which is still too high. Another option is 9 + 8 - 3 - 1 = 13, which is close but not quite. The best approach seems to be 9 + 3 + 1 + 8 = 21, and then subtract 6 (but we don't have 6). We need to find a valid combination that results in 15.\n\n[OUTPUT] 9 + 3 + 1 + 8 - 6 = 15 (but 6 is not available). Try combining 8 and 1 to get 8, then 9 + 3 + 8 = 20, which is too high. Try 9 + 3 = 12, and then 12 + 1 + 8 = 21. Try 9 + 8 = 17, and then 17 - 3 - 1 = 13. Try 9 + 3 + 8 = 20, and then 20 - 1 = 19. Try 9 + 1 = 10, and then 10 + 3 + 8 = 21. Try 8 + 3 = 11, and then 11 + 9 + 1 = 21. Try 9 + 1 = 10, and then 10 + 8 - 3 = 15.
