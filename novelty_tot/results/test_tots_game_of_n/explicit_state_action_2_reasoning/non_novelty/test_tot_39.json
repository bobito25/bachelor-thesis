However, the problem requires that all numbers (3, 7, 8, 9) must be used exactly once. Since 7 and 9 are still unused, we need to incorporate them into the solution without affecting the target value of 11.\n\nOne way to do this is to combine 7 and 9 using an operation that results in 0 (so it doesn't change the value of 11). This can be done by subtracting them: 9 - 7 = 2, but that doesn't help. However, if we use 7 - 7 = 0 or 9 - 9 = 0, we would be reusing numbers, which is not allowed.\n\nInstead, we can use the fact that multiplying by 0 eliminates a number, but we cannot create 0 from 7 and 9 without reusing numbers. Therefore, we must find a way to use both 7 and 9 in a way that doesn't change the result of 11.\n\nThe simplest solution is to use 7 and 9 in an operation that results in 0 (e.g., 9 - 7 = 2, but we need 0).
