One possible way is to try combining numbers step by step. For instance, 5 + 7 = 12, and then 12 + 4 = 16, which is close to 15. Alternatively, 5 * (4 - 1) = 15, and then we need to use 7. However, this approach uses only three numbers. We need to use all numbers. Let's try combining 5 * (4 - 1) = 15 and then see if we can incorporate 7 in a way that doesn't affect the result, such as 7 - 7 = 0. But we don't have another 7. So, let's try another combination.
