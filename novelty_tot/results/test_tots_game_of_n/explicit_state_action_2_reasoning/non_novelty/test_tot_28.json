One possible approach is to try multiplying some numbers to get close to the target and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's consider multiplying 2 and 7 to get 14, and then adding 1 and 9 to get 10. If we add 14 and 10, we get 24, which is too high. Alternatively, if we subtract 1 from 9 to get 8, and then add 2 and 7, we get 9, which is still not enough. \n\nAnother approach is to multiply 2 and 9 to get 18, which is the target number. Then we can check if the remaining numbers (1 and 7) can be used in a way that doesn't affect the result. Since we need to use all numbers, we can try subtracting 1 from 7 to get 6, and then adding 6 to 18 to get 24, which is too high. \n\nLet's try a different combination: 9 + 7 = 16, and then 2 + 1 = 3. Adding 16 and 3 gives 19, which is close but not 18. \n\nIf we try 9 + 7 = 16 and then 2 - 1 = 1, adding 16 and 1 gives 17, which is still not 18.\n\nLet's try multiplying 2 and 9 to get 18, and then check if we can use 1 and 7 in a way that doesn't affect the result. If we subtract 1 from 7 to get 6, and then subtract 6 from 18, we get 12, which is not helpful.\n\nIf we try 7 + 1 = 8, and then 9 - 2 = 7, adding 8 and 7 gives 15, which is not 18.\n\nLet's try a different approach: 9 + 7 = 16, and then 2 * 1 = 2. Adding 16 and 2 gives 18, which is the target number. This uses all the numbers: 9, 7, 2, and 1.\n\n[OUTPUT] 9 + 7 + 2 * 1\nReasoning: The expression given is 9 + 7 + 2 * 1. According to the order of operations, multiplication is performed before addition. So, we first calculate 2 * 1 = 2. Then, we add 9 + 7 + 2 = 18.
