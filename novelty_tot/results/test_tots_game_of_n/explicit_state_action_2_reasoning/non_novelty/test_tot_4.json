However, the problem requires that all numbers must be used. Since 1 and 8 are still unused, we need to combine them in a way that does not affect the result of 18. \n\nWe can do this by combining 1 and 8 with an operation that results in 0 (e.g., 8 - 8 = 0 or 1 - 1 = 0), but since we cannot reuse numbers, we can instead combine them with an operation that neutralizes their impact, such as multiplying by 0 or adding 0. However, we cannot introduce new numbers.\n\nInstead, we can combine 1 and 8 with an operation that results in 9 (e.g., 8 + 1 = 9), but this would change the result. Therefore, the only valid way is to ensure that the unused numbers are used in a way that doesn't affect the final result of 18.
