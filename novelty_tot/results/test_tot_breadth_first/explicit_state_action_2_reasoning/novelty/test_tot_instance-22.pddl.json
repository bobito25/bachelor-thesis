Therefore, the orange block must be picked up first.\n\nTo pick up the orange block:\n- The orange block must be on the table and clear. However, the orange block is currently on the table but is not clear, as the red block is on top of it.\n\nTo pick up the orange block, we must first unstack the red block from the orange block:\n- The red block is on top of the orange block and is clear (since the blue block is on top of it, not on the red block).\n- Unstacking the red block is allowed because it is on top of the orange block and is clear.\n\nAfter unstacking the red block, the orange block becomes clear, and the red block is now in the hand.\n\nNext, we can put down the red block (to make space for the orange block) or stack the red block elsewhere. However, the goal is to stack the orange block on the blue block, so we need to pick up the orange block first.\n\nAfter unstacking the red block, we can pick up the orange block:\n- The orange block is now clear and on the table, so it can be picked up.\n\nOnce the orange block is picked up, we can stack it on top of the blue block:\n- The blue block is on top of the red block and is clear (no block is on top of it).\n- The hand is holding the orange block.\n\nStacking the orange block on top of the blue block is allowed.\n\nAfter this action:\n- The blue block is no longer clear (the orange block is now on top of it).\n- The orange block is on top of the blue block.\n- The red block is on the table (since it was put down after being unstacked from the orange block).\n- The yellow block is still clear and on the table.\n- The hand is now empty.\n\n[OUTPUT] The orange block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the yellow block is clear and on the table, and the hand is empty.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nI am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks.
