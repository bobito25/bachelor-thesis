Therefore, we can load `package_0` from `truck_2` into `airplane_0` at `location_2_0`, then fly the airplane to `city_0`, and finally unload the package at `location_0_1`.\n\n[OUTPUT] Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_2_0.\nTo load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_2_0, the following conditions must be met:\n- package_0 must be at location_2_0.\n- airplane_0 must be at location_2_0.\n\nFrom the current state:\n- package_0 is in truck_2, which is at location_2_0.\n- There is no information about the location of airplane_0, but for the action to be valid, it must be at location_2_0.\n\nAssuming airplane_0 is at location_2_0 (as required for the action to be valid), the action of loading package_0 into airplane_0 can be performed. This results in:\n- package_0 no longer being in truck_2.\n- package_0 being in airplane_0.\n- truck_2 remains at location_2_0.\n- airplane_0 is still at location_2_0 but now contains package_0.\n\n[OUTPUT]  \ntruck_2 is at location_2_0 and contains no packages.  \nairplane_0 is at location_2_0 and contains package_0.  \npackage_0 is in airplane_0.  \nAll other entities remain unchanged.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nI have to plan logistics to transport packages within cities via trucks and between cities via airplanes.
