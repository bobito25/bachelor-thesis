Currently, package_0 is at location_1_0, and truck_1 is not present in the world. However, truck_0 is present and is at location_0_0. Since all locations within a city are directly connected, we can drive truck_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0 (both in city_0 and city_1, respectively, but the truck can only move within its city).
