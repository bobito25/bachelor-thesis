The goal is to have package_0 at location_0_0. Since truck_0 can drive between any locations in the same city, and location_0_0 is in city_0 (while location_1_0 is in city_1), we need to move truck_0 to city_0. However, the truck cannot directly drive between cities. Therefore, we need to use the airplane to transport the truck to city_0.\n\nBut since the truck is already in city_1, we can drive the truck from location_1_0 to the airport in city_1, which is location_1_0 (already there), and then fly the airplane to city_0. However, the airplane is already at location_1_0. So the next step is to drive the truck from location_1_0 to location_0_0, but this is not possible because they are in different cities.\n\nInstead, we need to fly the airplane from location_1_0 (airport in city_1) to location_0_0 (airport in city_0). Then, we can drive the truck from location_1_0 to location_0_0 (if the truck can be transported by airplane). But trucks cannot be loaded into airplanes.\n\nSo, the correct plan is to drive the truck from location_1_0 to location_0_0 directly, but since they are in different cities, this is not allowed.
