This requires:\n\n1. Loading `package_0` into a truck or airplane (since it is currently at `location_0_0`).\n2. Transporting it to `location_1_0`, which is in `city_1`.\n\nCurrently, `truck_0` is at `location_0_0` (which is an airport in `city_0`). This makes it the ideal candidate to load `package_0` and transport it to `location_1_0`.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1. Load `package_0` into `truck_0` at `location_0_0`.\n2. Drive `truck_0` from `location_0_0` to `location_1_0` (since both are in the same city, `city_0`? No, wait: `location_1_0` is in `city_1`, not `city_0`. That's an issue. `truck_0` is in `city_0`, and `location_1_0` is in `city_1`. So we need to move `truck_0` to `location_0_0` (already there), load `package_0`, and then drive to `location_1_0` only if it is in the same city. But it's not.\n\nSo the correct plan is:\n\n1. Load `package_0` into `truck_0` at `location_0_0`.\n2. Drive `truck_0` from `location_0_0` to `location_0_1` (in `city_0`) \u2014 to ensure it is in the same city.\n3. Fly `airplane_0` from `location_2_0` (airport in `city_2`) to `location_1_0` (airport in `city_1`) to prepare for unloading.\n4. Load `package_0` into `airplane_0` at `location_0_0` (if possible, but it's already in `truck_0`).\n5. Fly the airplane with the package from `city_0` to `city_1` and unload the package at `location_1_0`.\n\n### Correct Plan:\n1. Load `package_0` into `truck_0` at `location_0_0`.\n2. Drive `truck_0` to `location_0_1` (same city, `city_0`).\n3. Load `package_0` into `airplane_0` at `location_0_0` (but `truck_0` is at `location_0_1`). So we must first drive `truck_0` back to `location_0_0`, unload the package, and then load it into the airplane.\n\n### Final Plan:\n1. Load `package_0` into `truck_0` at `location_0_0`.\n2. Drive `truck_0` from `location_0_0` to `location_0_1` (same city).\n3. Drive `truck_0` back to `location_0_0`.\n4. Unload `package_0` from `truck_0` at `location_0_0`.\n5. Load `package_0` into `airplane_0` at `location_0_0`.\n6. Fly `airplane_0` from `location_0_0` to `location_1_0`.\n7. Unload `package_0` from `airplane_0` at `location_1_0`.\n\n### First Action:\n[OUTPUT] Load package_0 into truck_0 at location_0_0.\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe package_0 is at location_0_0, and the truck_0 is also at location_0_0. Since both are at the same location, we can load package_0 into truck_0 at location_0_0. This action satisfies the restriction that a package can only be loaded into a truck if both are at the same location. After loading, the package is no longer at location_0_0 but is in truck_0.\n\n**[OUTPUT]**  \n- package_0 is in truck_0  \n- truck_0 is at location_0_0  \n- truck_1 is at location_1_1  \n- truck_2 is at location_2_1  \n- airplane_0 is at location_2_0  \n- location_0_0 is in city_0 and is an airport  \n- location_1_0 is in city_1 and is an airport  \n- location_1_1 is in city_1  \n- location_2_0 is in city_2 and is an airport  \n- location_2_1 is in city_2  \n- location_0_1 is in city_0  \n- package_0 is not at any location but is in truck_0.", "used_prompt": "You are a smart assistant that answers concisely.\nYou will be given a problem / question to solve.\nThis is your problem statement:\nI have to plan logistics to transport packages within cities via trucks and between cities via airplanes.
