Locations within a city are directly connected (trucks can move between any two such locations), and so are the cities. In each city there is exactly one truck and each city has one location that serves as an airport.\nHere are the actions that can be performed:\n\nLoad a package into a truck. \nLoad a package into an airplane.\nUnload a package from a truck. \nUnload a package from an airplane. \nDrive a truck from one location to another location. \nFly an airplane from one city to another city.\n\nThe following are the restrictions on the actions:\nA package can be loaded into a truck only if the package and the truck are in the same location.\nOnce a package is loaded into a truck, the package is not at the location and is in the truck.   \nA package can be loaded into an airplane only if the package and the airplane are in the same location.\nOnce a package is loaded into an airplane, the package is not at the location and is in the airplane.\nA package can be unloaded from a truck only if the package is in the truck.\nOnce a package is unloaded from a truck, the package is not in the truck and is at the location of the truck.\nA package can be unloaded from an airplane only if the package in the airplane.\nOnce a package is unloaded from an airplane, the package is not in the airplane and is at the location of the airplane.   \nA truck can be driven from one location to another if the truck is at the from-location and both from-location and to-location are locations in the same city.\nOnce a truck is driven from one location to another, it is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.\nAn airplane can be flown from one city to another if the from-location and the to-location are airports and the airplane is at the from-location.\nOnce an airplane is flown from one city to another the airplane is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.\nYou must always specify the location of every loading and unloading action.\n\nGiven the start state truck_1 is at location_1_0, location_2_0 is in city_2, airplane_0 is at location_2_0, location_1_0 is in city_1, package_0 is at location_0_0, location_2_1 is in city_2, truck_2 is at location_2_1, location_2_0 is an airport, location_0_1 is in city_0, location_0_0 is an airport, location_0_0 is in city_0, location_1_0 is an airport, location_1_1 is in city_1, truck_0 is at location_0_0 and the goal atoms package_0 is at location_0_1, generate a plan to reach the goal state. [PLAN]\nThis is the plan so far:\nLoad package_0 into truck_0 at location_0_0.\nDrive truck_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0.\nFly airplane_0 from location_2_0 to location_1_0.\nLoad package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.\nFly airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.\nUnload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.\nDrive truck_0 from location_0_0 to location_0_1.\nNow you must find the next step.
